    If u/jake2b is right about the 10 days = 5th of November, then just wanted to leave this here. Can’t think of a much better date for the MOASS to start.

    Same clock different 9

    Because there aren’t enough posts with this clock /s.
Haven’t seen any photos of this one before. All the other clocks have the same 9 except for this one.
What if Ryan new there might be some delays so the day is 9 and the month is between 10 and 12 depending on how things go?

    Tinfoil interview suggestion
  </div>
  
  <div class="mdl-card__body">
    Now that we’re hopefully reaching the end of the play and while we wait for this to play out, ppseeds should compile a list of tinfoil theories so that if/when he has a chance to interview/talk to everyone behind this play we get to know if any of the “clues” were actually clues and which ones were never anything but tinfoil.

PS: sorry if I’m using the wrong flair
