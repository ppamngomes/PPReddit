ZERO.<br/>\nThe Feds will find a way to print the money, whether it be through war, pandemics, really anything.<br/>\nThe people that run congress &amp; white house are all intertwined in this market together, its not crashing on their watch, oh no no.<br/>\nLove him or Hate him Trump is winning the 2024 election &amp; their will be no shenanigans about it, hell democrats will welcome him with open arms, why?
