A bevy of these self proclaimed whales spewing vitriol, and when confronted they immediately state how they\u2019re down 10s of 1,000s of dollars as a way to add credibility and justify their negativity. \n\nSupposedly a number of these \u201cwhales\u201d were so convinced in this play that they purchased 100,000+ shares, but they\u2019re now bemoaning how much money they lost now that they\u2019ve supposedly sold them all off.  More experienced traders realize that someone with enough extra cash to buy 100,000+ shares, isn\u2019t at all concerned with losing a measly $20k.  That\u2019s pocket change to someone with that level of wealth, but I believe this kind of nonsense could prove persuasive to those less experienced traders involved here.  \n\nI don\u2019t pretend to know how to run a subreddit, or if enacting a \u201cproof or ban\u201d rule is even feasible.  If it is possible though, I don\u2019t see how that wouldn\u2019t be a pertinent addition to remove what seems to be the go-to option for those wishing to spread FUD here.", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
