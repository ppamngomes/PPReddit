I\u2019ve seen too many creepy creeping horses on Twitter from the likes of GameStop and Jordan Holdberg and probably others that I have forgotten to dismiss this theory that has been slowly forming in my mind so here goes\u2026..</p>\n\n<p>What are the chances that RC, Icahn, Pulte, and who knows who else - have accumulated funds to submit a stalking horse bid that is completely absurdly high (at least at face value).  In other words - the stalking horse bid would not be looking for a good deal, but instead would set a floor price for the remaining shares.  Initially, this would seem like a terribly stupid plan, but\u2026\u2026if they believe (or know) that the theory of many multiples of the float existing is true it would make sense\u2026.at least to a regard like me.  What if by simple division the stalking horse bid, after paying off remaining debts, sets the share price at\u2026.say $10?</p>\n\n<p>I know this theory is a hope and a prayer at this point, but wouldn\u2019t it be a valid investment if they knew that there were, say, 5x shares out there since they get to set the floor for 1/5 (or whatever multiple you think is true) the cost?  If a new ticker is created or an m&amp;a occurs the shares must be bought up right?  Seems like free money to anyone with enough cash to set the floor price.  Almost comical unless my maff is off.</p>\n\n<p>Doesn\u2019t this seem like a stunt one or more of these altruist billionaires might pull?  </p>\n\n<p>What set me off and provoked me to finally post this was Elon\u2019s follow up to the \u201cI am become meme.  Destroyer of shorts\u201d -&gt; \u201cAnd they keep coming back for more\u201d.  He also said in an interview \u201cOffer me money / power / I don\u2019t care\u201d.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/cFB2Kx0DtJM\">https://youtu.be/cFB2Kx0DtJM</a></p>\n\n<p>I think he\u2019s in on it or knows something about it.  Agree? Disagree? I don\u2019t care.</p>\n\n<p>Peace out - Craiger</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
