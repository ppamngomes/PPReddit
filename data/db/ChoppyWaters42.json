No way he gives shorts 14 days to cover.  They will use DOM or Overstock to exit Ch11 and the initial plan may sound bleak - this will be by design in my opinion.  After exiting CH 11,  and near the end of Sept  - Teddy is announced, shares are merged into new ticker etc. with very little time for shorts to cover.

This is speculation of course, reasons being is the confidentiality agreement being one - keeping everyone in dark resulting in price staying down bc no one really knows anything.  Second the court order of those with 4% holdings can\u2019t sell with out court approval - thus big HF\u2019s can\u2019t cover resulting in keeping the price from running.  Just wonder the reason - why wait for it to run?   There is a plan just wish I knew it \ud83d\udc40", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
