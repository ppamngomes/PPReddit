I defended PP, the show and Pulte and that angered him. I stupidly accepted a PM from him and I am sharing what transpired. I was literally very nervous because I have no idea who this person is and what he is capable of. </p>\n\n<p>It is clear that the mods have decided that what he did doesn&#39;t warrant a ban from the sub, so please take this as a warning, especially women, to tread carefully with him. He maybe is a good dude and had a bad day, but there should never be an excuse for this type of behavior. I imagine I am about to get banned for posting this and if I am, then it is clear that harassment and threats of doxxing are tolerated but calling it out is not. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/175oa7z/video/ls7x023rwmtb1/player\">https://reddit.com/link/175oa7z/video/ls7x023rwmtb1/player</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
