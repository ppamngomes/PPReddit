It takes away from the goal of an m/a and only prolongs the inevitable at the expense of the shareholder. The board already stated on a recent filing that even an rs is useless. I have been very bullish on bbby and still am. I even voted for but after the rc tweet I don't think the board has us in mind. Especially, given that they are , with an emphasis on Sue, overpaid execs. The main board is running amok with mindless regards that refuse to engage in a discourse and I'm just asking someone here to please tell me otherwise. We need a takeover, there is no denying it. An rs would kill those prospects. \n\nSide note: I just got this kepcap out of all the hype that took a month to get to me. Just wanted to show it off.", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/6jk9ys4gqrta1.png\"/></div>"}]
