I personally have them in IBKR and they did not disappear, whereas for people with BBBYQ they did. Other reports from people that have German BBY shares in Trade Republic and Comdirect that are also still there.<br/>\nIf there is any M&amp;A, new ticker, etc. will we be left with phantom shares? Does anybody know what happened to past bankruptcy emergences with stocks trading in foreign exchanges?</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/MDQYw6X9gHYjS8vhg67mjphxLyga7P0F6B9cBXAeOnw.jpg\"/></div>"}]
