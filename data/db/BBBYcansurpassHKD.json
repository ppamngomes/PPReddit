I want to add one caveat and one additional point. </p>\n\n<p>Basically the TLDR of Anasthera&#39;s advice is: once you are wealthy, get an estate attorney ASAP; an estate attorney is critical to protecting your assets. You can look for law firms in your area on chambers.com.</p>\n\n<p>This is great advice but I want to add: Utilizing personal/professional connections is essential to finding the best attorney for you. Cold calling firms from chambers.com is okay, but it is not going to open all doors or get you the best service. An example from personal experience - my family&#39;s estate attorney directly told me that he doesn\u2019t have a website because he doesn\u2019t like working with people from \u201coff the street.\u201d And let me tell you, a lot of attorneys feel this way because there are a lot of litigious idiots/scam artists/people who try to get out of paying their attorney bills/assholes out there and if you cold call any legal professional, they will be wary of you. </p>\n\n<p>So what can you do to have the best law firms welcome you with open arms? Get a referral. </p>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t have any rich friends that can put you in touch with their attorney, then go to your bank and talk to a banker (not a bank-teller, a real banker.) All the bank&#39;s big clients have attorneys and banks also have their own attorneys to deal with finance law, so the banker should have a long list of local law firms and will likely have opinions about many of them. After they give you the name of a law firm, ask them if they know how the firm prefers to be contacted and, if needed, if the banker could give the firm a heads up that you will be contacting them. This way the law firm knows (1) to be expecting you, (2) that you have been &#39;screened&#39; by a professional they have worked with in the past.</p>\n\n<p>BUT HERE THE MOST IMPRORTANT PART:  When contacting legal or financial professionals via email, you must use specific, professional wording. In your first message:</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t say, \u201cI want to hire you.\u201d  Instead say, \u201cI would like to engage your services.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t say, \u201cHow much do you charge?\u201d  Instead say, \u201cCould you provide me your fee schedule?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It is also good to mention if you are single, married, or in a domestic partnership so they can quickly grasp who all will be involved with the estate planning process. Below are two example email messages.</p>\n\n<p>___________________________________________________</p>\n\n<p>Subject: Estate Planning</p>\n\n<p>Hi [Ms. Attorney],</p>\n\n<p>I was referred to you by [First and Last Name of Banker] at [Bank]. </p>\n\n<p>I am interested in engaging your services to create an estate plan.
