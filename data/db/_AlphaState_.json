We all have faith and trust this community, including the \u201cwhite hats\u201d (RC, Pulte, etc). If nothing happens this week, does it discredit our thesis? Fuck No. </p>\n\n<p>One thing I learned from another [redacted] community that also had hype dates and tinfoil was timing and patience. Some would get discouraged if hype dates never panned out the way <em>we</em> anticipated. Understand that tinfoil may not always be used to communicate with us degens, but rather, other white knights involved in the play, or for a miriad of other reasons.</p>\n\n<p>So although predicting dates is fun, it is just one part of the bigger plan. I love tinfoil more than anyone but I understand that anything can happen especially since it\u2019s out of our control at this point. So whether something happens this week or a month from now, nothing will change for me. My convictions remain strong and my faith in this community and our favs (RC, Pulte, Icahn, Larry, etc) will never waver. I know that we are on the right side and I\u2019m convinced this world will ultimately be changed for the better.</p>\n\n<p>As I recall Kais\u2019 wife asked Pulte in NY if Kais will be a millionaire. Pulte responded \u201cYes, but you must be patient\u201d. Patience is what stuck out to me. So, let\u2019s be patient but remain as hopeful as ever. Touch some grass and detach from technology for a bit. The timing of this is extremely critical. Let\u2019s also not forget the fact that the DOJ is most likely involved. Again, this can\u2019t just happen willy nilly. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.</p>\n\n<p>If we blast off next week you all know we\u2019ll be fucking here for it and my nips will be painfully jacked and battle-hardened. During that time, we will see the results of our DD, amazing community, hopeful determination and faith driven persistence. We will also come to realize the mission that has been bestowed upon us: To make this work a better place. </p>\n\n<p>So buck the fuck up, remain zen, remain humble and touch grass. Understand that we are part of something so much bigger and truly special. </p>\n\n<p>To fucking Uranus fellas \ud83d\ude80 We already won in more ways than one.

You need special permission from your teacher for this to happen. In the legal world, this is somewhat similar. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>Background</em></strong><em>:</em> <strong>There is a situation that needs to be dealt with in a court.</strong> Think of it like a problem that needs solving.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Application</em></strong><em>:</em> <strong>Somebody (like a lawyer) has asked the court for permission to do something special.</strong> This is like your friend asking the teacher if they can join your group.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Review</em></strong><em>:</em> The court looks at what the person asking for permission (the lawyer) has said and all the documents they provided, just like your teacher would review your friend&#39;s request.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Rules</em></strong><em>:</em> The court follows certain rules (like school rules) to decide if they should say yes or no. They mentioned some rules like &quot;Fed.R.Civ.Proc.78&quot; and &quot;D.N.J. L.Civ.R.101.1,&quot; which are like the school&#39;s guidelines.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Good Cause</em></strong><em>:</em> <strong>The person asking for permission needs to give a good reason.</strong> This is like your friend explaining why they want to join your group and how they can help.</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: After looking at everything, the court decides to say yes or no. <strong>In this case, they said yes.</strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>Permission Granted</em></strong><em>:</em> The court allows a person named <strong>George Calhoun, who is not from the same area (out-of-state attorney), to help in the case</strong>, but there are some conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>Conditions</strong>: <strong>George can help, but someone who is already a member of the court&#39;s lawyer group needs to officially say they&#39;re in charge and receive all the important papers</strong>. Think of it like your group project leader who receives all the emails and updates.

However, I\u2019ll explain a scenario or two as to why it may be the absolute last resort.</p>\n\n<p>We have to first remember that in order for your brokerage to go belly up and \u201cforce\u201d close customer positions is if those very financial institutions who have short positions themselves becomes insolvent. Which means, several financial institutions will have to go bankrupt FIRST.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take one step back and look at the derivative market. Just imagine $10+ quadrillion in derivative exposure. Many of these financial institutions that have short positions on GME, BBBY, and many others are also indirectly tied to each other in the derivative market, especially the synthetic shares (naked shorting). So not only will the financial institutions who are directly shorting these companies need to go bankrupt first but also all the other institutions who are indirectly or directly tied to each other within the derivative market as well. Here you can see an explosive chain reaction.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if the FED decides to initiate bailouts like they did in 2008, then the Federal Reserve will indirectly feed the short squeeze (Pay Us) as they continue to bailout all these over-leveraged &amp; illiquid institutions. Remember not much will change in the FED\u2019s policies until 2025 so they are stuck between a rock and hard place.</p>\n\n<p>The FED may have to choose between two options:</p>\n\n<p>1- Collapse the market &amp; people go to prison.</p>\n\n<p>2- Pump in stimulus and allow the market to die through inflation, thus delaying prison sentences (not for long).</p>\n\n<p>The politically advantageous thing to do will be to print money and inflate. Which means, you can set some pretty nice price targets.</p>\n\n<p>I understand the DRS argument and have some DRS\u2019D myself, however, let\u2019s get back to the DD. In reality, DRS is a tool for a long term investment and the thing to really pay attention to is the <em>politics</em> of the situation rather than the fundamentals. Regulators &amp; Congress typically respond politically while bailing out WallStreet to keep save their hide.</p>\n\n<p>Inflation will just simply delay prosecution and that\u2019s more or less the option they will choose if they want to \u201ckeep\u201d this god awful centralized system.</p>\n\n<p>These people are serious morons and had their hand in the cookie jar long enough. No matter the outcome it won\u2019t be pretty for them. They will become more blatant with their crimes if they are money hungry or less likely, do the right thing and let this entire fraudulent financial system collapse. In either case, a decentralized system will be ready to pick up the pieces and start fresh.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

If we were to look at the BBBYQ dockets *objectively* it&#39;s abundantly clear that RC is interested in BBBY/Baby. RC&#39;s name is even listed under the interested parties as well as a creditor (both RC and RC Ventures) in a number of dockets. This is even a widely supported view by many on Twitter/X and reddit. BUT... here&#39;s the kicker. If I were a master chess player (I am not), but if I were, I&#39;d use RC&#39;s following with GME as the biggest head-fake when it comes to BBBY. I&#39;d make RC&#39;s interest in BBBY *appear* as the obvious player in this saga the entire time. I would allow the media/FUD to eat this up, allow the SEC &amp; regulators to be easily distracted by unfairly targeting RC, and if that wasn&#39;t too much, anyone involved on the other side of this acquisition (hedge funds, banks, lawyers, etc) will make the process painstakingly difficult for RC to acquire BBBY.  I&#39;d even go one step further to highlight what Pulte mentioned about RC. Pulte mentioned that RC is being targeted &amp; that &quot;we must protect this man [RC] at all cost&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>So, what if this was the plan all along? Make RC the &quot;front man&quot; in this saga, meanwhile there is another &quot;white hat&quot; or a group of &quot;white hats&quot; in the background waiting for the appropriate time to reveal their hand.....</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.&quot;<br/>\n- Sun Tzu (Art of War)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a way, one could even envision RC as the poster child who takes all the &#39;slings and arrows&#39; for the cause while allowing everyone (even us) to be convinced that RC is the main conductor in this play. Hell, even MSNBC, CNBC, shows like Jim Cramer, Documentaries, Investopedia, etc all paint RC as someone who is simply into &quot;meme&quot; stocks, attacking his credibility and downplaying his intelligence &amp; vision as a legitimate leader in the corporate world. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wy71mbscunnb1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3fad1001c7c70aa2e5729ead768d5ba340d3eeb\">https://preview.redd.it/wy71mbscunnb1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3fad1001c7c70aa2e5729ead768d5ba340d3eeb</a></p>\n\n<p>So.... Who is someone we believe to be involved but we hardly ever hear anything about him? Even searching on Google &#39;News&#39; we barely see any information about him and when we do, a majority of information typically pertains to his father. So, who is this man?</p>\n\n<p>Brett Icahn.</p>\n\n<p>Like many of you, I believe there are multiple people involved in this play AND I also believe that each person has a specific role to play.  RC very well may be orchestrating this play but if I were a grand chess master, I&#39;d convince everyone to believe RC is the obvious interested party (publicly) so that all the attention can be placed onto him (unfairly), when in reality, the conductor may be someone else entirely or someone we least expect.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, just food for thought.

It settles them into predictable  patterns of response, occupying their minds while you wait for the  extraordinary moment \u2014 that which they cannot anticipate.&quot;  </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;Thus the expert in battle moves the enemy, and is not moved by him.&quot;  </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;Be extremely subtle even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely  mysterious even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the  director of the opponent&#39;s fate.&quot;   </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.&quot;   </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.\u201d   </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;Mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy.&quot;  </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.&quot;  </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;You have to believe in yourself.&quot;  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>STAY STRONG. STAY VIGILANTE. TRUST YOURSELF. UNITE.   </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s time to party.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

It\u2019s clear these institutions are in place to try and convince us this is a legitimate financial system. However, they\u2019ve know for a very long time that this system is beyond corrupt, criminal and completely counterfeit. </p>\n\n<p>So knowing that the USD and many other fiat currencies are literally fake, what keeps the gravy train going &amp; why is this important to understand for a MOASS event?</p>\n\n<p>Answer: Simple: Confidence or the belief that this market is \u201creal\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Here is my hypothesis of how this could play out-</p>\n\n<p>1) Prevent Mass Liquidation.  I see this as the least likely event and I\u2019ll tell you why. Confidence, confidence, confidence. In order for these scum bags to continue pillaging society of its wealth, they NEED people to believe in the system. If they stop a liquidation event that is triggered as a natural result of illegal behavior then it becomes evidently clear that this entire financial system is a complete fraud as no one plays by the \u201crules\u201d. Remember, this fucks created the \u201crules\u201d. The people (including good members of Congress) will haul in the bankers and regulators for criminal activity if they prevent a legitimate consequence of their illegal behaviors. Also remember, 2008 wasn\u2019t that long ago for people to memory-hole the entire situation.</p>\n\n<p>2) Mass Liquidation. I believe this is more likely. If it were between jail time OR losing money while retaining confidence in the system, I believe they will choose the later. Primarily because this will give these scum bags a glimmer of potential hope to continue this illegal charade but in a \u201cdigital form\u201d <em>cough</em> CBDC, in which they can \u201cpatch the rules\u201d to further benefit their self serving interests. In a way, they need a liquidation event to usher in their \u201cfresh\u201d digitally corrupt system.</p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, IF our thesis is correct about TEDDY with some form of blockchain technology that competes directly with Amazon overnight, we effectively rug pulled the entire CBDC system, circumventing it without any bloodshed. Not only will we get PAID but we naturally participate in an economy that is completely separate from the US FED &amp; IMF. Most importantly, this new economy benefits everyone: shareholders, customers and businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than companies being run by pieces of shit CEOs and crushed by naked short sellers, these companies will be built on service, security, customers, value and quality. </p>\n\n<p>Who wouldn\u2019t want to be involved in this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

The second part of our mission is to hopefully capitalize on this moment in time, not only to improve our lives but also to help those around us.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to believe that the main difference between BBBYQ and the other stonks (AMC, GME, etc.) is that we are fairly open-minded, willing to change our opinions based on information and discussion, and ready to hear opposing viewpoints and ideas. We support one another, including apes in other stonks, and we provide a healthy mix of amazing DD, tinfoil + hopium to keep us motivated while moving forward.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever happens in this journey, we have accepted two fates: Zero or Hero (Food Stamps or Lambos).... and we\u2019re perfectly fine with either outcome. This is a QUALITY that is extremely rare in our society, and it&#39;s unfortunate to see so many people struggle to find meaning in their lives or choose to miss out on an amazing opportunity due to fear, uncertainty, or doubt. But honestly, who can blame them? This isn&#39;t for just anyone. Instead, this moment has been prepared for super-special regards like yourself :)</p>\n\n<p>Each and every one of you should keep your heads held high, as you have an incredible sense of conviction, perseverance, patience, and unwavering commitment to this mission. But to get here, many of us had to develop these skills. These skills may have been developed from difficulties, trauma, or regrets that many of us have experienced at some point in our lives. Rather than turning difficult experiences into negativity or guilt, each of you has found a way to internalize these hardships and transform them into a learning experience, i.e., to improve yourselves. You should all be incredibly proud of this, and I cannot emphasize this point enough.</p>\n\n<p>Although I have never met many of you face-to-face, I honestly consider all of you family. To some, this community may be the only family they have. Cherish this community and this moment in time. Understand that everything happens for a reason, and we all have a purpose. This is not simply by chance or a roll of the dice.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone here has contributed (in one way or another) to the incredible growth, and the bond that we share has developed this community into something incredible. There are very few people I&#39;d risk my life or fight beside... and I&#39;m confident to say that I&#39;d be happy to fight alongside each and every one of you. You all have earned my trust, and I hope the feeling is mutual.</p>\n\n<p>To conclude, I encourage all of us never to forget where we came from. I believe each and every one of us has a calling to a higher purpose. Let&#39;s not lose sight of this, as it will keep us grounded and provide us with the ability to care and love others during difficult times.</p>\n\n<p>No matter what happens, I love you, and I can&#39;t thank you all enough. And no matter how this plays out, this is only the beginning of great things to come.</p>\n\n<p>With love,</p>\n\n<p>Fellow Regard</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
