Maybe I should save for the weekend... but fuck it I&#39;m high and concerned with aliens, and thinking so deep lately. but check out what Pablo Sender says from 59:00 to 1 hr mark in this video:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/HV1VRtvhb_A\">https://youtu.be/HV1VRtvhb_A</a></p>\n\n<p>After reading the tao de ching and other text, and really actually starting to pursue the rabbit hole of zen (being spiritually ruffled in my feathers by all this), I started down this other rabbit hole of theosophy which seems very harmonious with tao. It&#39;s helped me boil down some stuff about out-of-body consciousness, the possible explanations of dark matter and energy, how consciousness affects reality (double slit+observer stuff), etc. It hasn&#39;t gotten cult like yet from what I can tell. It&#39;s probably not for everyone, but I really think that RC is perhaps at a point where he is producing such a positive effect on people that universal consciousness is shifting in his wake.</p>\n\n<p>I love the rabbit hole and it makes me feel more at peace with the wicked side of the world. Basically we are entering into a new epoch, away from the materialistic world, and towards that of the &#39;astral&#39; plane, and further yet the buddhic plane. Highly recommend Pablo sender to anyone struggling to cope with the darkness of this world. But I can understand that it isn&#39;t for everyone too. I come from a western, scientific background and have had a hard time with my peers thinking I&#39;m batshit insane while discussing the gravity of these stonks and what they mean for our nation.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9c God bless you all \ud83d\ude4f</p>\n\n<p>Pp if you want to remove this that&#39;s totally fine. I totally get it that this is reaching far and borderline not even remotely relevant.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
