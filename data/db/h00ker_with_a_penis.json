Just a BoBBY freaking out about the shares he has with Ally and trying to figure out what&#39;s going on. Long time listener, first time caller (I&#39;ve never posted to this sub before but I&#39;ve been following BoBBY since last August) so I apologize if I frig this post up.  </p>\n\n<p>I have 1,850 shares with Ally Invest. I logged in this morning and the ticker reads &quot;B126811&quot; and the Last Price, Bid, and Ask all show $0.00. </p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, the shares had the &quot;BBBYQ&quot; symbol and a Last Price value of $0.0789. Is anyone else seeing anything like this??? The rest of my shares are with AST and there are no changes there at all.</p>\n\n<p>I called Ally Invest I was told over the phone and now over the chat feature that the SEC Finalized the bankruptcy on 10/2 and that the shares have been cancelled.</p>\n\n<p>The quantity still shows 1,850, the customer service rep told me over chat that they are a placeholder and the security is worthless. Then he tried to offer me some kind of &quot;worthless security form&quot; to have them removed, which I declined.</p>\n\n<p>Is anyone else seeing this or something similar?!?!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
