I have no involvement with any other public companies including $BBBY or $BBBYQ. </p>\n\n<p>WHY did he do this? Because he is stomping the TinFoil dead in its tracks! </p>\n\n<p>Why hasn\u2019t t RC done the same??? That\u2019s the question \ud83e\udd14 </p>\n\n<p>If RC was not involved in BBBYQ, wouldn\u2019t you think that he would have done exactly what his buddy Larry Cheng did? He absolutely would!  </p>\n\n<p>If he is not involved in BBBYQ and is not planning on screwing the shorts and not taking the shareholders on a wild ride with him on the Road To Victory\u2026then he would have sent out a definitive tweet that he was not involved. </p>\n\n<p>If he is not involved and didn\u2019t tell all of us shareholders that he isn\u2019t involved, I\u2019m pretty sure he knows the damage to his reputation that would cause with very influential and supportive shareholders of BBYQ and GME.</p>\n\n<p>Just my opinion. </p>\n\n<p>Tommy T\ud83d\ude0e</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
