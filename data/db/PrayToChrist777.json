She said this (cant remember exact quote, but it had this meaning) on tape, and she is very respected in her field, so it cannot just have been taken out of the ass.</p>\n\n<p>It makes me think. If BBBY is 5b dollar company (perhaps this includes nols, dont know), with 1.5b in debt - some of which may be in the form of bonds held by a fren, meaning debt could be in practice substantially lower - how the fuck could BBBY loose this, mathematically?</p>\n\n<p>Either Holly was wrong in her appraisal - but its consistent with a certain other high profile dude, valuing the crown jewel in &quot;billions&quot;.

If so, where is this value heading? </p>\n\n<p>This holdup is dramatic, sure. But we will see, some time or other, where the value of this play is heading. In Hollys appraisal, the bare value of BBBYQ estate is 3x higher than its debt (1.5b debt vs 5b value). Again, this possibly excludes the nols, making it a ratio of 1:4 (debt:assets). </p>\n\n<p>Add to that; last time a basket stock rose significantly in value due to shorts fuk, another basket stock cleared its debt entirely and aquired a $1b cash warchest. This situation is exponentially worse by any metric.</p>\n\n<p>I am serious - can anyone tell me how the fuck BBBYQ estate can lose?

What are you gonna do post-moass?", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Yo bros whadup?</p>\n\n<p>Just stopping by to say hi, and to share some thoughts. Im fucking excited for this! Ill tell you why: one faithful night in feb 2021, i got intense feeling that i should go all into GME. This was when it was really volatile. I knew nothing about it, was just a guess - i told myself i was gonna hold one day, and close before market close. Got in at like $120 (as i remember), it went up to $140. I thought: &quot;this was fun!&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>That was now two years since, i did not sell, but started to read, and the very intense research brought be into BBBY. I know its been a crazy two years for all of us. There have been good days, exciting times, but also alot of stress and hard times. </p>\n\n<p>Here is why im excited: within one week, its very likely that we have a verdict. Next tuesday is 12th sept. As i am perfectly regarded, im not in the position to say that &quot;if we have nothing on or before 12th sept, its over&quot; - as I dont know. But i will say this: <strong><em>we are on a timeline that, regardless of the exact details, is coming to an end very shortly</em></strong>. Its hard to take in, i guess, for all of us. For better or worse, this chapter that for many of us started in early 2021, is very soon completed and we will know, what all these speculation, vagueposting, cues, tinfoil - we will know what it actually amounts to.</p>\n\n<p>I still trust RC, i trust the board, i trust Sue. I do not, for one second, think that these are people that are willing to smile on camera (remember Sues last interview, days before BC?), while knowing that houndreds of thousands of average joes are going to facetank financial ruin. RC knows 100%, about quite well founded speculations on his engagement in BBBY, and if he were not in he would 100% have signalled that very explicitly. But he hasnt, to the contrary he shows up again and again.</p>\n\n<p>I have put literally 100% of my assets, and then alot extra (full degen, for better or worse), on the line for this. If this fails, I will face the destiny of my parents, and their parents, and their parents, etc - I will wagecuck until the day i die, allowing nothing more and nothing less than a middleclass life to my family. It would be hard for us initially, but we would make it. I would be sad, but i could live with it. </p>\n\n<p>But if there is a plan, if the tinfoil holds, the speculations are true, if two years of DD is roughly right. You know what? I have put everything on the line, but i would not move one inch above middleclass regardless. But these years, i have tasted what its like to be financially challenged, poor tbh. I had to ask my parents for help (despite being a working man, having two jobs) a couple of times, fucking embarrassing. But im extremely grateful for what these years have taught me. If moass would have happened in 2021, i would have been a dick with a lambo.</p>\n\n<p>Post-moass i just want to help people. In India, there are children who are literally slaves, sold for $3k per person. I have spoken to single mothers who are getting squeezed out, cause of inflation, from their apartments. </p>\n\n<p>Post-moass, I would help some parishes getting churches. And i want to start a fund or similar to help poor families, to get them jobs and perhaps housing. If you wanna go lambo, do it and enjoy it, this is not me shaming apes or anything like that. Im gonna get some things for myself. But i am personally very grateful for what i have learned during these two years - the entire economy is a sham, a farce, and a great injustice, and i dont want to live for cash or material wealth anymore, i want to live to help others. Im also thrilled about the next chapter beginning, for better or worse, real soon.</p>\n\n<p>If you read my blog, thanks and God bless. If you have dreams for what youre gonna do post-moass, do tell :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I will be as brief as possible. What i want in return, is answers - is this theoretically possible? Im not saying THIS WILL HAPPEN! - im asking if this is a possible way of squaring everyones interests here, that keeps squeeze play intact.\n\n\nOk, so look at this:\n\nFrom the First Day Declaration we know that the secured debt and bonds were: (millions)\n\nABL: $80.3\nFILO: $547.1\nFinance Leases: $61.5\nLoC: $102.6\nTotal secured: $791.5\n\n2024 Notes: $215.4\n2034 Notes: $209.7\n2044 Notes: $604.8\nTotal Notes: $1029.9\n\nTotal secured + Notes: $1821.4\n\n\nYesterday, they said closing sales netted an amount that is sufficient for doing away with secured debt, roughly $800m give or take. Left is a billion of secured notes, and thats it.\n\n\nGo on, under the following assumption: assume that the majority of noteholders will convert the notes into equity/other compensation related to the coming company, e.g. TEDDY. Then there is zero secured debt+notes left to pay.\n\n\nMeaning that left on the table are the NOLs, $1.6b free money. ASSUMING that bondholders are okay with compensation in form of ownership of new company (this likely was the plan all along, and the way e.g. Icahn has aquired companies before), and they intend to run new company to make use of NOLS. Theoretically, the entire NOL space can be used to bring BBBYQ shareholders into the game of e.g. TEDDY, for up towards $1.6b, and the equation still holds net positive. Note, im not saying this will happen - im saying this is a way to make sense of playing BBBY estate right now in a way that keeps everyones presumed interests intact. Whoever is bondholder, gets proportionate share of new company, that will to BBBY\u00b4s job in entirely slimmed and trimmed fashion, you bring shareholders with you, and you have 100% exposure to entire squeeze play scenario. Ch11 killed off the dead meat, that was it.\n\n\nIf one would want a onestop destination, pertaining to e.g. baby shit, this is a \"simple\" way to do it.
