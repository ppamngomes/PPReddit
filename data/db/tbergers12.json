Here are a few reasons why a company might do this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> By disclosing the presence of preferred shares and stock warrants in the retained earnings section, the company is being transparent with its shareholders and other stakeholders about the potential dilution or impact on future earnings.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Accounting Treatment:</strong> Accounting standards require companies to account for potential dilutive securities, like preferred shares and stock warrants, that could lead to the issuance of additional shares. This is done by reducing retained earnings or recording a liability in some cases, even if the shares or warrants haven&#39;t been exercised yet.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Potential Impact:</strong> The company wants to convey the potential impact on earnings and shareholder equity in case these preferred shares or warrants are exercised in the future. This helps investors understand how these instruments could affect the company&#39;s financials.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Legal and Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Companies must accurately represent their financial position, and that includes accounting for the potential impact of securities that might be exercised or converted in the future.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Disclosure Requirements:</strong> Depending on regulatory requirements, companies might need to provide detailed information about their capital structure, including potential dilutive securities, in their financial statements and related disclosures.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Ultimately, listing these securities in the retained earnings section is a way for the company to provide a comprehensive picture of its financial position and potential impacts on equity. It&#39;s also important for investors and analysts who evaluate the company&#39;s financial health and prospects.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Retained earning can only be distributed to shareholders via a cash or stock dividend.  As you can see Convertible Preferred shares and exercised common stock warrants of 70 million shares each have been taken out of the positive retained earnings.  Each transaction is roughly $3 billion dollars for 70 million shares each.  This is at a value of roughly $40 per share!  My theory is a reverse merger with BBBY maintaining greater then 50% will retain control with one entity to maintain the NOL loss of $3.5 billion (preferred shares transaction).  A second transaction (dividend) a spin off of buy buy baby.</p>\n\n<p>These dividends are then placed in the liabilities sections on the balance sheet until they are distributed to shareholders.
