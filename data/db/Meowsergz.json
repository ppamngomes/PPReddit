That would mean shorts have to scramble and buy back shares causing an epic squeeze, yes.</p>\n\n<p>But..</p>\n\n<p>What if RC is still in this play like we all assume and would hold a 50% stake (to preserve NOLs) making a push for bbby to be bought out by gme with a share exchange.</p>\n\n<p>Wouldn&#39;t that mean shorts on bbby have no way out in closing bbby without having to buy gme shares? And if gme shares have to be bought by bbby AND gme shorts that would be the MOASS right there. Shorts on both sides getting fucked at the same time by 1 entity. </p>\n\n<p>69D chess move?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
