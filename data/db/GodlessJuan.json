Didn\u2019t do a whole lot of digging, but what I did find was that Diebold fucked their shareholders, but ultimately exited bankruptcy, PLx is still in bankruptcy and no acquisition announcements have been made that I can find and Boxed was purchased by MSG Distributors for an undisclosed amount. I\u2019d be VERY interested to hear from any former BOXD shareholders as from what I\u2019m reading they also fucked over shareholders. </p>\n\n<p>The reason this caught my eye is that I found a link that shows there is a strong similarity between boxed.com and buybuybaby.com.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the link to the article\u2026</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/online-wholesaler-boxed-acquired-after-filing-for-bankruptcy/\">https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/online-wholesaler-boxed-acquired-after-filing-for-bankruptcy/</a></p>\n\n<p>The last paragraph is the most important part of the article and reads as follows\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUpdate, 8/23/23: MSG looks like it may have bought another company as well:: buybuybaby.com as the website, indicating it\u2019s under new management, and has the exact same landing page, FAQ, and layout as the Boxed.com website. MSG has not responded to repeated requests for comment\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Now I\u2019m not saying that because Diebold and (maybe) Boxed screwed over shareholders that Bobby is planning to do the same\u2026 honestly this might just be a big ass nothing burger! I\u2019m only sharing this since I haven\u2019t seen it discussed yet and having more folks look into it might reveal some more tasty secrets. For me, personally, I would just like to find some former BOXD shareholders and squeeze them for info! Lol.</p>\n\n<p>Still zen. Still holding (runaway shares apparently \ud83d\ude02).

Just please provide sources for your arguments.</p>\n\n<p>First, let me state that I am FINE being in expert markets! I\u2019m expecting new shares of a reformed or bought out company! I could care less if we were trading in rocks! But I still am obsessed with learning about this shit.</p>\n\n<p>So\u2026 I wanted to know\u2026 how <strong>does</strong> a company come out of the expert market? </p>\n\n<p>Well for those that don\u2019t know, you have to find a <strong>market maker</strong> to file a form 211 for your company and have all other relevant filings up to date in regards to rule 15c2-11. Won\u2019t go over everything involved in that, but it generally just requires the company make a couple SEC filings and obviously find a market maker to, well\u2026 make a market for them! So I found a LOVELY site that went over all the market markers that deal in OTC stocks and started digging into them fucking alphabetically\u2026 <strong>BAD IDEA!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Literally do NOT do this if you want to retain your sanity and also get sleep ever! Lol there are many, many pages and the information certainly isn\u2019t up to date as some of these firms are no longer around or have since restructured to something else or have parent companies and several subsidiary companies. It literally goes alphabetically from A-W as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong>- In all likelihood, the images \u201cmay\u201d not give you sufficient information and you may actually have to Google some definitions on your own, naturally, but If there is anything you don\u2019t understand I\u2019m happy to answer questions to the best of my ability!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here is a some brief, some not so brief overview of just SOME of the market makers I dug into that I found interesting</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>ACAP Financial, inc</strong> (EXPELLED BY FINRA FOR REPORTING ISSUES. Determined to be weird because I actually called FINRA this week and they told me they don\u2019t know the company listing requirements to be removed from the expert markets and be properly quoted on OTC and that I would need to contact OTC markets for that information\u2026 TF do you not know your own disclosure requirements?!)</p>\n\n<p><strong>C.L. King &amp; associates</strong> (100% woman owned investment bank.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Domestic Securities, Inc</strong> (Most of my images are about these guys and market implementations made in the late 90\u2019s, early 2000\u2019s. Other then the related images 1-10 [I truly am sorry\u2026 I\u2019m doing this on my phone so a brief description for each photo can be found at the very end], I found VERY limited info on them other than they are based in Montvale, NJ although their OTC division was/is in Edison, NJ as most recently I could find on Linkdin and yellowpages.com\u2026 So yeah, I can\u2019t even find out if they are around anymore. I want to also mention this particular one was on a page listed as \u201cP&amp;S debt\u201d, the P meaning purchase, S meaning Sale. Which is more clearly defined in the image about P&amp;S.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>J.P. Turner &amp; Company</strong> (This one was actually a bit interesting to me as well as they effectively shut down in 2014 and were acquired by RCS Capital Corporation, a brokerage firm, which also underwent a chapter 11 bankruptcy\u2026 wait, aren\u2019t brokerage firms not allowed to file chapter 11? Maybe I\u2019m missing something as I am a bit tired and this took a LOT of reading! So anyways, through the proceedings, they took private their advisory firm called Cetera Financial Group. They did this and successfully exited chapter 11 after coming to an agreement with their first and second lien bond holders, but they completely wiped out their shareholders in the process\u2026 but I guess I don\u2019t care so much about shareholders investing in shady brokerage firms lol, which apparently they did have some shady activities happen before their bankruptcy filing. Won\u2019t go into it. Don\u2019t want this post to be too long, but the info is out there!)</p>\n\n<p>(So anyways, upon further digging into them, I found they emerged as Aretec Group, Inc under the parent company of GC Two Intermediate Holdings, Inc, a holding company in Delaware that also had a lil scuff with the SEC back in 2020 in regards to the Investment Company Act of 1940. Lol I guess I lied and I am somewhat going into it because it was essentially Cetera Advisors, LLC that committed the alleged fraud, not their parent companies or other subsidiaries. Won\u2019t go ANY deeper into it besides to say it was essentially a fraud case of failure to disclose certain compensations.)</p>\n\n<p>SOURCE: <a href=\"https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/25078682/a-complete-list-of-market-makers-for-otc-listings\">https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/25078682/a-complete-list-of-market-makers-for-otc-listings</a></p>\n\n<p>Now I\u2019m just going to stop here because as we can NOW see, there\u2019s a TON of market makers that deal in the OTC market and I don\u2019t even think this article is up to date, as it\u2019s first page directs you to <a href=\"http://www.otclistings.com\">www.otclistings.com</a> which appears to no longer even be an active site as it redirects me to <a href=\"http://www.domainmarket.com\">www.domainmarket.com</a> and upon scrolling down a bit, even has a link to purchase the domain for otclistings lol, but yumpu.com seems legit.</p>\n\n<p>Geez, I hope your brain hasn\u2019t switched off yet because what I find most interesting of all I saved for the last image!.. But yeah it\u2019ll be described further below.</p>\n\n<p>I do apologize for the length here ladies and gents, but I do want to bring your attention to 3 other images and one other detail I found strange\u2026 If you go to images 11-14, this is also mentioned in the case in 2002/2003 with SEC v. Domestic Securities, Inc, I will detail the importance of each image at the end of the post IN ORDER. Again, sorry if you\u2019re on mobile and you have to do a bit of scrolling back and forth. I did my best and it\u2019s after 02:30 here so I\u2019ll be posting this tomorrow (which if you\u2019re reading this, it\u2019s tomorrow\u2026 but is it ever tomorrow? Lol). It has to do with some weird ass looking shit to do with FIX (Financial Information Exchange). I guess if it\u2019s not weird just tell me it\u2019s not weird and we\u2019ll all go about our days! </p>\n\n<p>Ok so let\u2019s get into the images.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IMAGE 1:</strong> This goes over an SEC rule implementing something called SuperMontage into the markets. Domestic Securities, Inc challenged this implementation, but essentially it was thrown out because Domestic was late in filing its objection.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 2:</strong> Looks like a lot of other folks were not for this SuperMontage shit either!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 3:</strong> This goes over \u201ccrossed and locked\u201d markets and how Domestic was basically challenging a feature of SuperMontage called decrementation. What decrementation does is essentially allow market makers to zero out or push to the back of the line any limit orders that did not get filled for\u2026 well, pretty much any reason the market maker didn\u2019t want to fill them! Definitely suggest looking up decrementation!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 4:</strong> This just explains what a crossed market is basically. A locked market is when ask/bid prices are the same.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 5:</strong> So there\u2019s also something called ECNs that functions with SuperMontage that were giving market makers a way to escape filling these OTC limit orders for customers. More on ECNs in the ECN image next.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 6:</strong> So yeah, ECNs we\u2019re around BEFORE SuperMontage and also seems to also, at least if I\u2019m interpreting it right, allows market makers to trade back and forth for their best price while ignoring the customers limit orders.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 7:</strong> Just your boiler plate explanation of how NASDAQ is actually a creation of NASD. If you don\u2019t know about them, just do a Google search as I don\u2019t want this to drag on any longer than it has to! But as you can see they are a self-regulatory organization. Who\u2019s regulating you, NASD? Oh, NASD is? Ok, that seems on the level.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 8:</strong> Just goes over the basics of what SuperMontage is\u2026 but trust me bro when I say there\u2019s a LOT more to it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 9:</strong> P&amp;S transactions. This was mentioned earlier as Domestic Securities, Inc was listed on a page titled \u201cP&amp;S\u201d. It\u2019s likely nothing. Just meant they handled purchase and sales of securities?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 10:</strong> This is another argument made by Domestic about SuperMontage and something I found very interesting in the following images just due to the connection to FIX\u2026 detailed in the next few images.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 11:</strong> Might wanna read that highlighted part a couple times and then head over to the website!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 12:</strong> Explains the role of FIX in the markets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 13:</strong> So if you DID happen to go over to the website, and you clicked on the link for \u201cmember firms\u201d you\u2019ll see a line of things you can click on from buy/sell side dealers/institutions etc, etc\u2026 it contains all the usual suspects\u2026 Blackrock, Credit Sussie, Goldman Sachs, etc, etc... What I found SUPER weird was when I clicked on the section titled \u201cregulators\u201d I just got ASIC. What is ASIC? So far as I can tell, ASIC is the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission. TF?! The ONLY regulator for FIX is this Australian securities commission? Btw, if you try to click on them it tells you that you need to be a member and have an account to view any info on them. Is it weird? Idk, but it sure does seem fishy! At least to me!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 14:</strong> FINALLY! I already mention this one above, but this shows Lazard as an OTC market maker dealing in what? Convertibles! Do lambos come in convertibles? Lol. Lazard provides many services and as we know is currently in the service of BBB. Again, this info is obviously dated, but it\u2019s important to see this is/was a specialty of theirs in OTC exchanges.</p>\n\n<p>Last thing and I\u2019ll STFU I promise! I find it SUPER weird that all those Domestic Securities, Inc issues with the SEC were RIGHT around\u2026 actually I think after the time Clinton repealed The Glass-Steagall Act! Ya know\u2026 the act that prevented investment banks from doing shifty trades. If you don\u2019t know what it is DEFINITIVELY give it a Google search as some claim the repeal of this act had a material effect on the 2008 housing market collapse.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations if you read all of that and honestly, thank you if you read it all! It took a lot of work. I\u2019m sorry again if there\u2019s some info in here you find irrelevant.\u270c\ufe0f&amp; \u2764\ufe0f to all of you and enjoy your weekend!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "El Capitan America \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/AlCTRSkSqKILmtw4AvF6r6SXPoMXhxuZqd7LoSDE-zc.jpg\"/></div>"},

If you have legal or financial needs, seek a licensed professional if that is your decision to do so.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE REASON I CALLED (TWICE)</strong></p>\n\n<p>So I been doing some research about how an OTC stock exits the expert markets and of course came across rule 15c2-11. There\u2019s a lot of (a)(b)(c) (1)(2)(3)\u2019s to it, but generally speaking, it\u2019s essentially the rule that governs quotation in OTC markets by broker-dealers and market makers. </p>\n\n<p><strong>SO\u2026 WHY IMPORTANT?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well I think it\u2019s pretty darn important based on ALL the images I have included! FINRA, for those that don\u2019t know is the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency and they KNOW these rules and requirements!</p>\n\n<p>Ok, so of course I\u2019ll mark this a trust me bro because I could NOT and DID NOT record my conversation with FINRA, but only mean here to show I did call them.</p>\n\n<p>The first option I pressed was wrong I guess. I used option 3 for questions about securities I think? Well this guy was pretty chill and even offered to help at least TRY to find the answer to my question (which btw was what requirements must be met for BBBYQ to successfully come out of the expert markets). He told me they were kinda the wrong department and they were not really experts on the expert market and kinda chuckled about it a little. Seemed like a nice guy.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways he tells me I should have pressed option 1 for corporate action as they were more likely to know. I asked politely if I could be transferred to that dept and he said he could not do that and I\u2019d simply have to call back in\u2026 ugh, but w/e.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So I call back in. Option 1 this time</strong></p>\n\n<p>This guy has a whole different attitude about him, or at least that\u2019s how it came off to me. He kinda huffed after my question and then proceeded to tell me they have no information on that! (How a company comes out of the expert market) and the people I should be contacting is OTC markets. Well so I went over to otcmarkets.com and of course I found no phone number (if anyone has one for them, I\u2019d appreciate it!) and the contact method was \u201cHere. Give us your name, number, email and we\u2019ll get back to you\u201d.

Mostly because the most recent rule updates made by the SEC that effect us being in the expert market were made in Sept of 2021\u2026 <em>cough cough</em> GME era.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.otcmarkets.com/2021/03/25/understanding-the-expert-market/\">https://blog.otcmarkets.com/2021/03/25/understanding-the-expert-market/</a></p>\n\n<p>Note at the very beginning, there is also a link to the actual SEC rule update which is equally important to read in its entirety to fully understand the situation of being in the expert market!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Just a couple images in this one.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So the first image is from the link. You can actually head over there and type in the search bar \u201cBBBYQ\u201d. There\u2019s a lot of scary looking \u201cOh no! This company is in bankruptcy and it\u2019s not reporting to the SEC\u201d! Well um, Mr. SEC, we\u2019re not required to report to you in OTC! Maybe that\u2019s why he was soooo sad looking yesterday when his objection was overruled? He knows we got an ace buried soon to be dug up? Lol.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So anyways, about image 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>Image 1 is ACTUALLY explained more in detail in image 2!</p>\n\n<p>As set out in the new expert market rules, the trades measured on the expert market are unsolicited only. Meaning only measuring limit orders from those who are instructing broker-dealers to issue a limit order. So naturally I wish I had a million dollars already as I\u2019d be placing some high ass level limit orders between now and the 28th!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>So the expert market likes to not give price quotes on the OTC market for securities trading in the expert market. Or maybe just not immediately until THEY know the true price, but\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Psst. I have a secret to tell too. If you read all the articles, a security CAN come out of the expert market, JUST as an OTC stock can be re-listed on the major exchanges! \nOf course that\u2019s not what we\u2019re after though. Let\u2019s get real. We want NEW SHARES! (Although I won\u2019t lie, if BBBYQ goes into the hundreds/thousands/millions/infinity I\u2019d still be pretty happy!) lol.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not a legal or financial advisor and I offer no professional/client relationships. Any information contained herein is my own opinion and not meant to influence anyone in anyway. If you have specific legal or financial needs, you should seek a licensed professional should you so desire.</p>\n\n<p>I wanna add after my disclaimer here that I am NOT super familiar with the expert markets, but my night will be occupied with digging in more deeply to this shit!</p>\n\n<p>Also just wanna say I may have buried the lede here (IYKYK), but IF my assessment is correct, this information means short sales will no longer be tabulated in any future price discovery? I know positing this question opens the feed to a mass of shills saying I\u2019m wrong (maybe I am, I\u2019m not done researching damnit!), but bring it on!

So are you going to keep fighting the ACTUAL bad guys like the buff ass apes and apettes I know you are? Or are we going to continue the in fighting over dumb shit?</p>\n\n<p>We are sooo close! Quit calling people shills for asking questions. Look at their profile. If they seem like a shill just don\u2019t respond! WHY do some of us make ourselves out to be these all knowing god beings that shoot down ANY newcomer as a shill or an idiot and why do we have to peg them when they happen to be wrong?!?</p>\n\n<p>This is fucking COMPLEX stuff y\u2019all!
