I\u2019ve only been investing since January of 21\u2019. I would describe myself as a person with an above average IQ and a pretty good head on my shoulders when judging right from wrong. However, looking back I must say that without this sub I would certainly have folded my cards long ago, not knowing what I could potentially miss. I\u2019ve since learned to question everything before making any emotional decisions by following along and studying the DD. I\u2019ve learned how easily the public can blindly follow the MSM. (Myself included) But most importantly, I can\u2019t believe the amount of corruption I\u2019ve learned about. Quite frankly, it sickens me. I\u2019m so fortunate to have stumbled upon this community and joined the fight for what\u2019s right. I\u2019m confident that I\u2019m making the right decisions to hold on and see this journey through. Thank you to all that have contributed. This has been quite the few years for me and one heck of a learning experience. If it ends the way I think it will, this world should be a much better place. LFG! \nPS. It was embarrassing telling my wife that I\u2019m getting my information from a PP Sub. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

That\u2019s the way we liquidate the hedgies and change the future for the working class. If you believe in the cause, then we are the chosen ones. I have friends that don\u2019t have that many shares. I\u2019m holding for them. I have shares that I will never sell. I want everyone that has sacrificed to be able to bathe in the glory when we have lift off. I Don\u2019t care if they have one share or a million. Be proud of what you\u2019ve sacrificed! Be proud of what you\u2019re about to be part of. Never again will we have an opportunity like this to change our generational wealth. Exciting times ahead.
