Controlled Chaos asked everybody to give a status of the stores in their area. Our Bed Bath and Baby are located in the same shopping center, across the parking lot from each other. When I checked back in August, Baby had all blinds closed and \u201cFor Lease\u201d sign in the window.  Bed Bath was a Sprit Halloween. Today, Baby status is still the same and hasn\u2019t been leased out. As far as Bed Bath, Spirit Halloween has taken its main banner down and cleaned out the store except for their baskets.  Their last day of business was Nov 3.  Good news is there is no \u201cFor Lease\u201d sign on the Bed Bath location.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/nefBlJWUJjlbJTH1HfImWtQqDkh7DdeXQ-D0jdGyDl4.jpg\"/></div>"}]
