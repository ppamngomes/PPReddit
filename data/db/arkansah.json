Anyway,  the bad actors tried to cram  the bankruptcy through the court, however as a single-asset debtors ends up with a lot of right s in  this procedure.  He is able to join another class.  Such as the share holders the plan must be equitable and fair to all asset classes.  But since <strong>put write</strong>r cannot be compensated for his open position, the remaining assets must be divided equally  among all the classes.  Here is a kicker, that only applies to current, so they debtors won&#39;t get a part of the NOLs, but most importantly I think this demonstrates that we will get shares in the new company.  Another kicker, these debtor classes are often strewn together with creditors that aren&#39;t subject to the bankruptcy, usually nobody cares because there are no assets at all, but if they are found out, the class is invalid and they won&#39;t receive any distribution of assets.

The question is what happens to the put options after bankruptcy.  Well the persons that bought the options would make some money.,  the person who wrote would according to one website. Since it is the company that is going illquid and insolvent and not the person or institution who sold you those put options, you are guaranteed your profit and delivery. Pretty cool if you wrote the options.  You just made 595k+546k 1.141 million dollars and take delivery of of 210 million dollars that you could sell back into the market (let&#39;s say Monday or settle date) price was .18.  X 21 Million or another cool 1.68 million for a  total net trade of3.9 million roughly.</p>\n\n<p>However, here&#39;s the interesting part.  That written Put options are technically a long position What if the writer of the options doesn&#39;t want to get closed out?  He still 2 years for them to expire.  Well I couldn&#39;t find much information about it from then SEC, they only wrote about loans and bonds. However a  court case in <a href=\"https://law.asia/bombay-high-court-upholds-option/\">India</a> ruled that  person that sold the put option is technically a debtor. Yes it&#39;s India however these courts mostly operate under Maritime law.  And the put owner is technically being denied infinity profits. If the person wasn&#39;t one of the listed debtor, I believe they would have 14 days after the effective date to bring an action to the bankruptcy court.  That person or group will have a lot of power to wield over what happens if the effective plan has to be voided.  </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know if that person or group was listed as a debtor?  They may have also filed a a suit under Chapter 11 Section V.  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Can someone check my number on this option trade</p>\n\n<p>BBBYQ final price .08</p>\n\n<p>1 dollar strike</p>\n\n<p>Last price was .97</p>\n\n<p>Expires Jan 202</p>\n\n<p>open interest was  119,000. </p>\n\n<p>This would have given the options contract write the ability to purchase 11,900,000 share for just under .03</p>\n\n<p>.08-.03 .05 cents per share.or 595.000</p>\n\n<p>Another Trade for Options put</p>\n\n<p>Final price .08</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>dollar Strike</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Finale sale price </p>\n\n<p>!,98</p>\n\n<p>OpenInterest </p>\n\n<p>~91,000</p>\n\n<p>Share the options writer could have purchase at the end 9,100,000</p>\n\n<p>for .08 -.02 = .06 or 546,000</p>\n\n<p>Here is the interesting aspect</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
