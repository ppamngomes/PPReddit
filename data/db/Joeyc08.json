Shorts will pay us, the debts off, and then fuck off. (Houston wade thesis)</p>\n\n<p>Court docs exposed the naked shares, they could probably be sued for extra cash on top of the squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>Bed bath and Beyond will survive and complete the turn around, Hollie is the best at this.</p>\n\n<p>They should consolidate baby into the Bobby stores to reduce expenses and to increase foot traffic within stores. Moms can then pickup stuff for themselves and their babies instead of driving to another location.</p>\n\n<p>Bobby proceeds to whoop alibaba and amazons ass by offering quality products.</p>\n\n<p>Omnichannel model for online and brick mortar experience to offer fast shipping and a personalized experience. Consignment deals will have brands begging to be sold at their stores which reduces expenses for Bobby.</p>\n\n<p>When you think about Amazon you envision bezos (a former wall st shit head) vs the alternative of Bobby with a new ceo who might be RC (nice and caring kinda guy imo).</p>\n\n<p>The brand name is too valuable/well-known to be chopped up, the BEYOND keeps us open for a lot of potential with the company once it\u2019s in good hands. Even further it would be better to absorb/partner with GameStop and then sell their goods within the beyond part of the store.\nBed, bath, baby, electronics, games, etc.\nJimmy has mentioned more lately about exploring partnerships as well.</p>\n\n<p>Extra tinfoil includes may 16th is National bbq day and may is bbq month BBBYQ=BBQ what are the odds?</p>\n\n<p>Among other reasons Bobby was being killed along with other companies to avert the basket from being broken, most of this ties back to what\u2019s coming with Jimmy. After this event a new stock market will be born that will be fairer and more transparent for all players involved.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
