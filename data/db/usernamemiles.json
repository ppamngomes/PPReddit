Then on March 7, just 39 days after the tweet, RC reveals over three months between January and March he spent approximately 121 million United States Dollars on 7,780,000 shares and 1,670,100 shares of call options of Bed Bath and Beyond stock, 9.8% of the company, for a cost basis of about 15.34$/share. 45M more than the $76 million he spent on his GME buy. He also releases a very public message to the board like he did with GME.</p>\n\n<p>What else is happening in the world right at this point in time? Well the war in Ukraine is just getting started and INFLATION has sky rocketed to 8.5%!!! the highest since early 1980s. The Fed hasn&#39;t even started raising interest rates yet they\u2019re still at 0%!! The Fed would raise from 0-0.25% on March 17 just 9 days after RC buy.</p>\n\n<p>RC&#39;s BBBY buy was literally among the worst investments that could be made in the market at that point. The stock drops like a rock to 5$ and RC loses like $74 million in 4 months. Does that sound like something RC would do, a guy who has the absolute best financial experts, lawyers, and TA experts advising him? Well lucky for RC, like magic, the stock rockets from 5$ to 28$ out of nowhere on no news! Those darn memesters smh! I&#39;m not buying it for a second. Either RC knew there was some sort of financial engineering going on that would cause a big spike there or he caused the spike himself somehow or both. No way he does this without knowing 100% that he wouldn&#39;t lose 10s of millions investing in this terrible company, at the absolute worst possible time, when all eyes are on him from the GME squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>So RC exits at the top, profiting $68.1 million. In his GME DD interview he say he saw them buying back stock while not profitable and it changed his view of the company. Ryan, you knew that going in. Just like you knew that Baby was collateral for JPM loan and wouldn\u2019t be able to be sold, before you sent the letter suggesting it. Even if they managed to sell baby for a billion I don&#39;t think that would have kept BBBY going much longer. These leases where fucking toxic. No way to get out of them and no way to be profitable with them, big debts, no cash. BBBY were trapped and both Wall Street and RC knew it.</p>\n\n<p>This entire time RC hasn&#39;t given us any message that this isn&#39;t the play. If this works out, forever to come, we will continue to invest in Teddy, we will shop at Teddy, we will positively review Teddy, we will spread word of mouth about Teddy, we will positively review products on Teddy. But all of that can work in reverse for both Teddy and GameStop.
