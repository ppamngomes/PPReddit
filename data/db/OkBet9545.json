I\u2019ve attempted to respond to the majority of them. Thank you for the love I\u2019m overwhelmed. \n\nI\u2019ve had many ask me to come back into the show but would only consider doing so once a significant announcement is made. Allow me to clarify what I mean by that. Teddy will need to file an S-1. To me, every other announcement is an amuse-bouche and though hype generating I want the entr\u00e9e. Once that pops up on EDGAR maybe I\u2019ll come on the show though I\u2019m unsure of the purpose because the filing should be rather self explanatory. Within the S-1 look for any indicator as to what kind of shares (I\u2019m hoping ERC-721), when will they be listed/tradable, where the listing will occur, how many are being distributed and to whom. I anticipate both GME and BBBY holders will receive shares in proportion to their respective market caps on a given date. Short institutions are cooked and because of the game of hot potato with toxic assets they\u2019ve been playing, many will go under unless a significant bailout is provided.\n\nSome of you have indicated that SuperstoNk has plenty of peri/post moass guides. Feel free to use those instead. \n\n\u2014\n\nIf I had to summarize my advice using one website I\u2019d recommend the gold standard. Keep your life as simple as possible.\n\n[Chambers HNW/UHNW guide](https://chambers.com/legal-guide/high-net-worth-21)\n\nSpecifically focus on trust and estate law. Many of these firms have a private client division and they\u2019ll help you create a trust and estate plan hopefully preventing intestacy (or the need for resulting/constructive trusts) and fortifying asset protection. They also provide many other services worth considering. \n\nTax planning can be done in conjunction with your private client firm and likely a 3rd party CPA firm they\u2019ll guide you to. \n\nI\u2019d rather be overinsured than under. HNW/UHNW insurance brokers are around. Find one and use them. I like Newfront.\n\nIf you want alt-citizenship or residency I like Henley & Partners. I\u2019d avoid the Caribbean programs. Many other companies that offer these services are a scam. Tread carefully.\n\nYou can use a financial advisor, but I\u2019d never recommend one. They\u2019re some of the most unintelligent people I\u2019ve met and a lot of what they offer is a grift. I prefer broad market mutual funds (I like VTSAX but choose whatever you want) and then taking pledged asset lines against that whenever I want some capital. This will likely be purchased through your private banks brokerage offering (I use one that\u2019s domestic and another that\u2019s outside US Banking jurisdiction). THE KEY is to never actually sell the mutual fund but be prepared to stomach some unrealized losses (we should be well trained at this point).\n\nOh also learn to stay secure. Pay off all bad debt immediately and be incredibly organized. You have to treat yourself like a corporation. Use a password manager as well as TOTP 2FA in as many places as possible. I keep a separate email for anything to do with finance/law/health and don\u2019t give that out to the public. I even have a separate phone and number solely used for these services. iOS is more secure than Android. Google Privacy Guides though some of it I consider overkill. Get rid of all vices because wealth will potentiate them.\n\nI can only speak for men but always protect  women, children, and animals and treat people with respect. Be principled and honest. Do well, do good.\n\nI think that\u2019s all I have!\n\nGodspeed \ud83d\ude80\n\n-OKBET", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
