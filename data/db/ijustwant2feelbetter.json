That point cannot be argued. It is just a fact, per the Kroll filing.</p>\n\n<p>Now\u2026was this submission a smart idea that will end up beneficial for shareholders? That\u2019s the question.</p>\n\n<p>Based on what the judge said at the last hearing, he thinks this doc was submitted by someone with some sort of legal knowledge and appears to have worked with an attorney. If this is the same submission, my interpretation is that it seems like a couple of bullish Interest Party (Group 9) members worked with a general attorney to file a case on behalf of shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>Do I agree with all of the statements in the filing? Probably, I\u2019m also in Group 9 and plan to keep all of my shares in the INFINITY POOL because I want shorts to be scared of retail long term (and they deserve to get what\u2019s coming to them). </p>\n\n<p>With that said, the 1729 filing was NOT written by Kirkland &amp; Ellis, or Cole Schotz, or anyone directly associated with Bobby as the Debtors. </p>\n\n<p>Not sure what to think, but 15 AUG will be interesting.

This is NOT how that conversation ended. This was done with mal-intent, in my opinion, to create FUD that didn\u2019t tell the whole story.</p>\n\n<p>You all know the convo I\u2019m talking about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Judge didn\u2019t understand how the document can use both \u201cfully &amp; Final satisfaction\u201d and \u201cextinguished\u201d claims in reference to group 9 (equity holders) simultaneously. Judge KNOWS we won\u2019t be fully satisfied if we\u2019re extinguished and he wants the language to be consistent.</li>\n<li>Fiedler stated \u201cthey get nothing\u201d toward the end of the conversation\u2014 HOWEVER, this was only in reference to the ~$895M to which he referred at the start of the call. To ME, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s bad for current equity holders, because receiving payment as a shareholder in the form of this recovery cash could (speculating here) preclude us from getting stake in any future assignments (AKA, shares of a spinoff like Teddy)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To me, this conversation was net neutral because (1) this is going to squeeze no matter what (anyone see the hilarious attempt at crashing the price right at conclusion of the hearing? and (2) I\u2019d rather have shares in a well-capitalized new company that will be publicly traded WITHOUT the manipulation than some petty recovery cash</p>\n\n<p>My thesis: Bobby will squeeze and will do a share recall, then I\u2019ll get both paid AND get a shitload of shares in a new entity in exchange for equity in Bobby. No one will be able to manipulate the new stock price, which will be wholly owned by us \u2014 which will make the new entity super valuable again, on a per share basis , at which point one can either buy MORE with our initial Bobby squeeze money or SELL for even more cash to go target some shorts on the other hundreds of manipulated stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Not financial advice, and I\u2019m sure this will be downvoted so no one sees it anyway\u2013 but I hope someone can actually tell me where I\u2019m wrong if you disagree. I don\u2019t disagree we won\u2019t get any of the $895M in recovery funds**\u2026BUT THAT\u2019S NOT WHAT I\u2019M STILL HERE FOR\u2026** I\u2019m here because this thing (1) has been naked shorted at least DOZENS of times over and I KNOW it will squeeze and (2) I anticipate receiving shares in a new entity in exchange for my current holdings to my benefit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
