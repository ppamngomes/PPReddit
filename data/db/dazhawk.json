I have tuned in to listen to almost every PP Show for the past 6 months (and even OKbets and Salvatores space calls.) Guess you would call me a professional lurker as I never feel qualified to reply with anything of significant value to the show or to this sub. I&#39;ve been actively investing in stocks for the past 25 years and have come to learn the basics of naked shorts, synthetic shares, FTDs, short interest and all the other nefarious tools that SHF have at their disposal...here&#39;s what I&#39;m failing to understand. </p>\n\n<p>We have a LOT of very intelligent people in this community, and I would argue the communal knowledge rivals that of the punks at the hedge funds...BUT, they have access to the same information we do, if not more. If our thesis holds any degree of merit, then why in the world have they not been gradually covering their exposed short positions over the past couple of months? I would venture a very large wager that most, if not all, of their short positions are in the money. I highly doubt they&#39;ve been opening a significant amount of new short positions that are under water when we&#39;re trading at $0.20. </p>\n\n<p>What more do they stand to gain by holding out to $0? Especially if there&#39;s even a 10% chance that shareholders are made whole with a new plan supplement? I must be failing to miss something else about the market mechanics. They could have spent the past 3 months slowly and gradually closing their short positions without risking sending the price to Uranus in a few trading sessions and still made a TON of money exiting their positions and reducing their infinite exposure.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing something very obvious and would love to hear from the smooth brains as to how much more they stand to gain by holding onto their short positions when we&#39;re @ $0.20.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff4500"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
