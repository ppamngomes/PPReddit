Why you ask? </p>\n\n<p>If it\u2019s announced that you are supposed to get $10 per share then that\u2019s what you are supposed to get there is no they can just make more fake shares it\u2019s you gotta receive your $10 per share </p>\n\n<p>But here\u2019s the thing only $10 million was given to the DTCC by the acquiring company so if there is instead 100 million shares the other 99 million shares still have to receive their $10 each and this would come from the sources creating the naked shorts</p>\n\n<p>I know I know this doesn\u2019t = MOASS but it would be nice to see Robinhood or whomever all of the sudden go bankrupt twice</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
