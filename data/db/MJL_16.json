Each Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership of the securities of the Issuer reported herein except to the extent of his or its pecuniary interest therein, and this report shall not be deemed to be an admission that any Reporting Person is the beneficial owner of such securities for purposes of Section 16 or for any other purpose.</p>\n\n<p>SPECIFCIALLY THIS PART:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Securities of the Issuer owned directly by RC Ventures.
