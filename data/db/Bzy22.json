If anyone needs or wants a little added boost of hopium, you should do the same. </p>\n\n<p>Main takeaway: </p>\n\n<p>In the realm of distressed retail turnarounds, if Holly Etlin can\u2019t bring a company through the other side intact, it cannot be done. This woman radiates competence. Even among other distinguished turnaround experts on panels, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s the smartest person in the room. </p>\n\n<p>When shorts heard Holly Etlin\u2019s name as the temporary captain of the ship, I suspect there was a collective eye roll, followed by, \u201cJesus Fucking Christ, not Etlin!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Holly Etlin has been through the wars. She will not be tricked or caught unaware. She makes $70K a week for a reason. When David Kastin is confused, he probably goes to her for advice. </p>\n\n<p>Several times during her interviews, she stressed the importance of companies restructuring before it\u2019s too late. </p>\n\n<p>AlixPartners, her firm, was brought on board on January 10th. Q1 ended at the end of February. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if the NOL stuff has her fingerprints on it. </p>\n\n<p>Also, if this woman has material non-public information that counter parties do not have, she will use it to devastate them. Fuck them with their shorts on, so to speak. </p>\n\n<p>If the BBBY ship goes down, it won\u2019t be for a lack of child prodigies or NASA level math geniuses (Lombard) trying to bring it into port safely.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
