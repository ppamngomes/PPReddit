Google says this about the rule: &quot;Rule 15c2\u201311 governs the publication of quotations for securities in a quotation medium other than a national securities exchange (i.e., over the counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) securities). The Rule is designed to prevent broker-dealers from publishing or submitting quotations for OTC securities that may facilitate a fraudulent or manipulative scheme. Subject to certain exceptions, the Rule prohibits broker-dealers from publishing any quotation for a security or, directly or indirectly, submitting any quotation for publication, in a quotation medium unless they have reviewed specified information concerning the issuer.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Not sure what this means, I only ingest blue crayons through my nose.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
