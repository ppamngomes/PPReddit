This was not Beyond right? I think someone said he took BYON off his twitter profile. Are these two different companies still? Is there some behind the curtain theatrics taking place with a merger of Beyond and Overstock and Bed Bath?  I saw on a billboard on that building on one of these Reddits that Beyond was calling itself a parent company. Pretty confused right now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
