If Overstock does something to change their capitalization structure with the move to BBBY instead of OSTK, then that could change everything. Including the options market. </p>\n\n<p>Could still be a situation that the CUSIP needed to be completely cleaned out (hence the 10/20 date) before an S-1 could be filed by OSTK to reissue shares under the old BBBY CUSIP.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
