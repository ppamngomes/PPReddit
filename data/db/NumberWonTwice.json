Can we come to a clear understanding why RC is listed as a creditor on the CH 11 filings?</p>\n\n<p>From my understanding, if you are listed as a creditor, the company owes you money in some fashion.  I debated this very subject with a venture capitalist.  </p>\n\n<p>Our conclusions were RC either has bonds, or he is owed some sort of fee.  A CONSULTING fee? Ryan Cohen?</p>\n\n<p>Which of these two scenarios are more likely given the repeated disdain for consultants espoused in RC tweets?</p>\n\n<p>Are there alternatives to these two scenarios? Would like to put this to rest once and for all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
