I understand this is a loaded question, but if we emerge on a blockchain market, I am no longer concerned that bad actors can create more shares out of thin air. In theory, I don\u2019t hate those who want to short a stock. We all place our bets in life. It seems like this would be a good revenue stream for 20-84 years while the banks and market-makers pay off their debts that have been memorialized on an open chain instead of hidden in sleazy swaps and shuttered books (ahem, Switzerland). I want to make sure my family trust has shares in place when those books are opened in 49.5 years.
