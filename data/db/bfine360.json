Other &quot;normal&quot; stocks are commission free.</li>\n<li>Came in this morning, saw the price, wanted to buy some more.</li>\n<li>On the desktop browser, it would not recognize the BBBYQ symbol. On mobile app, it does.

Likely available Tuesday morning. </li>\n<li>May be too late then. Price may be at $0.00, $0.05 or $500.00. Who the fuck knows. I&#39;m along for the ride. Down 95%....what&#39;s another 5%.
