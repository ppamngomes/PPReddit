Especially lately. I&#39;m usually a very patient guy but this bbby play has got me jonesing for answers. Fucking luv the pp show. Last month or 2 it&#39;s really grown on me. I just like the stock and all the dd u guys are ripping apart. The positivity. Every episode I&#39;m listening while I tie Flys.  </p>\n\n<p>Anyways I noticed this week I&#39;m staring at my phone too much. It&#39;s kinda pointless to check it all day. Made a point to get some shit done. It&#39;s not like we can buy or sell right now anyway lol. I really appreciate it actually, I&#39;ve hodl and hodl and now I&#39;m forced to lol. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways my point is this. Get out of the house. Leave ur phone at home. Even a walk or some chores. It&#39;s good for ur mental health. This is a fish i caught recently, been making a point to get out every weekend lately. Smoked it with a candy brine. I suggest y&#39;all do something similar.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/pFDh7R1aJl-yDoVA7SRhUMsvOHbkI2ZrB9P9oHyMotk.jpg\"/></div>"}]
