Selling covered calls with strike prices above the current market price of a stock is a common strategy traders use to generate income.</p>\n\n<p>When you sell (write) a covered call, you receive a premium but must deliver your underlying shares if the buyer exercises the option. In return you are giving up the potential gains on your stock if it rises above the strike price of the option you sold and the buyer exercises it. You may also trigger a tax event if the option is exercised and, as a result, you are forced to deliver your shares.</p>\n\n<p>You can learn more about covered calls or other products and strategies in the IBKR Traders Academy.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/1yn1wec1pesb1.jpg\"/></div>"},
