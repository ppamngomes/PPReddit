(Gme &amp;Bbby).</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a relatively new bbby holder as per some OGs. I was able to get a nice bag of tickets for a low average. Over 50k shares.</p>\n\n<p>However I am an OG gme holder. So my average there sucks and is hard to lower. I went balls deep before I knew what was up. Just over 1600 with like 40 dollar average from like 60  (400 pre split).</p>\n\n<p>As of now, noone can do anything bbbyq related so I know many of you (us) are buying gme. This is great because its cheap atm. Apes just getting into gme are going to have an awesome average. </p>\n\n<p>My point is that I will not need to sell all my bbbyq or even many. If we get a cash +equity, I won&#39;t need to sell any.  Say there is no cash and just equity and we squeeze i can hold over 40k shares until the biggest bbby bagholder is green and rich; probably more like 48k held back. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time a new gme holder can hold almost all their shares until I am green and rich.</p>\n\n<p>We know for a fact we have purchased multiple floats on bbby just from volume and buy pressure in the last 2 months, also I know we have multiples owned over at gme.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe what I&#39;m saying is it will be easy to lock the floats indefinitely forever and even longer on both these nuggets if people individually with their own thought only sell from where they got the best deal.</p>\n\n<p>Then one could think,  if floats are locked and hedgies are being forced to buy... but they&#39;re locked, and they need to buy... \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 the fucking price is  \u267e .</p>\n\n<p>We can live on dividends!

Why spend the big money for nothing. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 fuk outta here with this bullshit.</p>\n\n<p>You think a company gets valued at 5billion and then sold for 30ish million. ooop sorry accounting error? Lol </p>\n\n<p>Do we realise that bbby was a profitable company destroyed from the inside out?</p>\n\n<p>Who signs overpriced leases and takes unnecessary loans for dumb interest, and does a  share buy back in the $30.00 then a dilution in the $0.30s ? Lol </p>\n\n<p>Ok so here we are. How long have you been holding? For most people a long time, for some the whole time, and for a bunch just recently. Most recent buyers (imo) are from Jimmy. Jimmy and Bobby are going to face fuk wallstreet. Thats where I came from, I&#39;m obviously still there (4\u00d7)  but I&#39;m here too 5xholder.</p>\n\n<p>Are you seeing any value yet? Ok 1 more.</p>\n\n<p>When bbby dropped like a bitch what did you do? Lol exactly buy the fukn dip. Who remembers trading close to 2 billion or well over 1 billion in the week before entering ch. 11  if you do then you also remember 90% buying pressure. Who did that? Thats right you did, I did, we did.</p>\n\n<p>So where is the value? You are the fukn value, I am the value, and that person in the corner eating a crayon wrapping tinfoil on his head is the value.</p>\n\n<p>We are unique, we have given the activists the green light to take the gloves off and destroy these bad actors. Create new goodness and make each and everyone one of us wealthy for doing so. We have been tested and proven to be 100% ride or die. This major shift play would not work with normal retail paperhanded bitches.</p>\n\n<p>Theres no company in the world with holders like this, this is a companies dream. We are the dream team. </p>\n\n<p>If we were going to lose, we would have already lost. Understand that. For me I love to toe the line, also I have never in my life had so much fun/excitement/stress/disappointment/all that stuff holding tickers ever. </p>\n\n<p>For when re run, remember if the $.50 calls hit they will push the price to 1.00 easy. When the 1 dollar hits itll send this bitch sailing passed the 2.00 if we hit 2.00 hang the fuck on because there&#39;s now billions of shares due and every short will be so badly underwater itll be insane. So where would it then stop? Lmfao who knows no price anchoring, but when supply and demand take over well.... whats a bottle of water worth if you need it to save your life right now and im the only one with water and there&#39;s 5 of you that need it. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.
