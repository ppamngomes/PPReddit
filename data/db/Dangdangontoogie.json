More bullish than even the 10 billion credit from ya boy meadows. However when I read the line \u201cconversion of existing obligations into equity or other securities involving the issuance of new securities\u201d it led me to a question that I believe is the end all be all question of this saga for me and for all of us, do they (the new buyers) have an obligation to us as share holders of (formerly) bbby or bbbyq and if they don\u2019t have an outright obligation is there any known legal frame work or precedent for a company to honor share holders without an outright legal obligation. If so than I am not bullish anymore I would turn gay for Ryan cohen and team. \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83e\udd8b</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/5y3t1x2yoyxb1.jpg\"/></div>"}]
