I&#39;ve spent a lot of time looking at state filings. One of my most time intensive things this last year. A lot can look one way, and digging deeper you see something else. If you think you&#39;ve found something, feel free to run it past me. I&#39;ll get back to you same day, and I&#39;m not gonna steal your scoop.</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s good to have people diggin in, after all that&#39;s how butterscotch came across the ending date of Dragonfly in Fl.</p>\n\n<p>The latest finding that&#39;s a buzz is simply from not redownloading the file again with the same name, and thus showing a previous file downloaded to the phone.</p>\n\n<p>----------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>Some reminders</p>\n\n<p>State level companies can have the same name in different states and not be at all related.</p>\n\n<p>If you see an interesting name like Teddy on a company name and it has none of the players anyone is familiar with, more than likely, it&#39;s something totally unrelated.</p>\n\n<p>Check the date of when the company started and if it&#39;s still active. A company that started in 1996 is not likely to mean anything at all, unless it&#39;s an old Bed Bath rebranded as yet another Butterfly.</p>\n\n<p>Opencorporates is great, but at the same time, actually logging into the state level website can yield more current information. A lot of times you need to spend at least a few bucks to see detailed filings.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t bother spending money on detailed Delaware filings - they&#39;re expensive at 20.00 a pop and we&#39;ve already looked into most of them. If someone want&#39;s to check on Dragonfly Group Inc there to see if it&#39;s still active though go ahead haha, could be interesting to see or nothing at all.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t be fooled by opencorporates calling companies a branch of another. It&#39;s not always accurate. It&#39;s just scraping data and is only as smart as what it was programmed.</p>\n\n<p>So keep searching, just dig deep and know you&#39;ll find 19 to 50 nothingburgers for every 1 or 2 branches that lead you down a funy but pretty tinfoily path. 1 in 100 to 1 in 200 that makes a stronger link.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a lot to be excited for, just don&#39;t want to see people get pumped and hopes dashed when they don&#39;t need to be.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Skip to the bottom for some goodness at least I wasn&#39;t aware of till now.</p>\n\n<p>So I had a silly little tinfoil post up earlier today. Siliier than I usually do. The share count ended about double what its upvote count was. 16 shares to about 8 upvotes seemed odd but things happen.</p>\n\n<p>So anyway, could be nothing, just seemed a little odd. Than I connected a dot and it at least makes it a bit more interesting. Maybe my post just completely sucked and people were bored with it.  Or there&#39;s another piece I&#39;m not seeing and you can help me solve.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t worry, I have lots of pictures.</p>\n\n<p>So this was my post from earlier. I visited Facebook&#39;s Buy Buy Baby page.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed that the baby is wearing Burt&#39;s Bees BaBY clothing (BBBY perhaps). Now, beyond the BBBY sync you could make, and that bees and butterflys are both pollinators, I continued on. Research is never done (lol).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4q0n8vyilwwb1.png?width=996&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5856da76210fd8adfa3f465603d8ab002e5b665e\">https://preview.redd.it/4q0n8vyilwwb1.png?width=996&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5856da76210fd8adfa3f465603d8ab002e5b665e</a></p>\n\n<p>So I headed over to Burt&#39;s Bees Baby website. The top image on site has bears and Teddy bears on child&#39;s clothing to the right.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, a fun little coincidence again. Of course this was basically just a fun little shit post. But then I remembered @ TeuHunden and <a href=\"/u/soulfly5555\">u/soulfly5555</a> post from earlier today on Twitter about the lawsuit with Ben Rosenzweig.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tfupltn2mwwb1.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f139f7fd2bcdc26fb3df9f4cc6c3e6e931c68e9\">https://preview.redd.it/tfupltn2mwwb1.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f139f7fd2bcdc26fb3df9f4cc6c3e6e931c68e9</a></p>\n\n<p>When I first heard about the lawsuit it did seem a little troubling. But looking deeper today, basically a slew of people sitting on the board of PFSWeb INC are being sued, in relation to their merger and takeover by GXO.  PFSWeb is now PFScommerce.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5o3dda57nwwb1.png?width=342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f7990ca9d3f93a41ecac6fe9ba166b926da3b6b\">https://preview.redd.it/5o3dda57nwwb1.png?width=342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f7990ca9d3f93a41ecac6fe9ba166b926da3b6b</a></p>\n\n<p>So I don&#39;t think Ben is being sued in relation to this case at all really. But here&#39;s an interesting bit. When I looked on the contact info for Burt&#39;s Bees I got this phone number. 855 540 2229. A Conneticut address or Texas address. 855 numbers are like 1800 numbers, not specific to a region.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5b6dp2gfnwwb1.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bb0b0a0abe4cde2d247599fba87569e4fd85130\">https://preview.redd.it/5b6dp2gfnwwb1.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bb0b0a0abe4cde2d247599fba87569e4fd85130</a></p>\n\n<p>Ok so the same phone numberes in two places, one at Ayablu, Inc is associated with Burts Bees, and the other Supplies Distributors, Inc. , is owned by PFSweb (now PSFcommerce under GXO).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wo9wjj1mnwwb1.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5be1ff283de82b25e2db4793bce5071636f87201\">https://preview.redd.it/wo9wjj1mnwwb1.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5be1ff283de82b25e2db4793bce5071636f87201</a></p>\n\n<p>And at the address listed for Allen TX linked to this number we get these residents.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wivqktlynwwb1.png?width=1589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ba9a537fbdcb8d81d1e4bac43a0a4d875df5a25\">https://preview.redd.it/wivqktlynwwb1.png?width=1589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ba9a537fbdcb8d81d1e4bac43a0a4d875df5a25</a></p>\n\n<p>Now LIvearealabs Inc was bought by PFSWeb Inc in 2013, then Livearea Inc ( i guess rebranded slightly, and was sold away from PSFWeb inc in 2021 to this Merkle company.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ls2zdns5owwb1.png?width=1578&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0459ce6440cbf9351a45ca9a46dd92467beeba1\">https://preview.redd.it/ls2zdns5owwb1.png?width=1578&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0459ce6440cbf9351a45ca9a46dd92467beeba1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9src95w6owwb1.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21f8935fe51a9e96b873dd5a36e21d63edc55d94\">https://preview.redd.it/9src95w6owwb1.png?width=1244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21f8935fe51a9e96b873dd5a36e21d63edc55d94</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m59xi678owwb1.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dae7908948ac00729b28400d8f7164ba0f4cb925\">https://preview.redd.it/m59xi678owwb1.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dae7908948ac00729b28400d8f7164ba0f4cb925</a></p>\n\n<p>Ok so no big deal. So basically this phone number linked to Burt&#39;s Bees is linked to PSFWeb (now PSFcommerce INC) is only tied to PSFwebinc (now part of GXO), and Supplies Distributor INC (now part of GXO as well, since they were both under PSFWeb).</p>\n\n<p>Merchandise liquidators for the PSFWeb portion they&#39;re listed under (even though their website doesn&#39;t mentioning them doing that??) and computers, peripherals , and software for Supplies Distributors inc. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g2y7cgd0qwwb1.png?width=383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4afb335164b1aaa602bd50c836bfeb598091c570\">middle two businesses sold off but still run operations out of that location it seems</a></p>\n\n<p>So not sure why they&#39;re listed as liqudiators here.

Disclosure: I decided to go from 37 to 50 a few weeks back, to now 98% Drs&#39;d this week. I don&#39;t think it impedes me at all for a squeeze being at AST.</p>\n\n<h1>Sections below-</h1>\n\n<p>[ Why Drs? ] [Sales and Squeegees ] [Starting the Process ] </p>\n\n<p>[ Registration ] [ International Apes ]</p>\n\n<p>----------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>Going to a friends birthday but I figured I&#39;d share my comment hat I made yesterday and expand a bit since it resonated with people. It answers a lot of questions I see. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll get back to any unanswered question here later tonight or tomorrow. And be rude and counter some ideas possibly as well. Cheers.</p>\n\n<h1>Why DRS?</h1>\n\n<p>You might at least consider the Dole case. They issued more shares then there were. Those who could prove they had shares directly in their name got first dibs on what was a cash straight pay out in that instance. The articles mentioning the situation don&#39;t spell out they were drs&#39;d precisely but it&#39;s pretty clear to me. Are you ok in Fidelity? Probably? But at the end of the day you&#39;re trusting a broker versus them being in your own name , and the ability to control your own shares.</p>\n\n<h1>Sales and Squeegees</h1>\n\n<p>Limitations- AST - I don&#39;t think I&#39;d sell in expert mode by AST since they&#39;re limited to market orders and there&#39;s no solid quotation system there for retail.</p>\n\n<p>Currently market sale by phone. You call in early the day before to guarantee a market sale the next day. Not a problem for me personally as I don&#39;t plan on being able to call a daily top, and I won&#39;t be selling anywhere near the .12 or .15 fee per share, for it to be substantial to me.</p>\n\n<p>If we&#39;re back to otc pink limited how we were shortly ago, or shares are exchanged for a new ticker on NYSE or Nasdaq, there should be no issue transferring back into Fidelity to sell if you&#39;d want to perform a limit sell or an at will market sale. I&#39;ve seen people comment their transfers back into their brokers take 1 to 2 days. I think that gives enough time if you look at squeezes. - VW - 3 to 4 days. Gamestop 2 weeks at least from start of run. Tesla - weeks and weeks, same with Overstock.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting the process. Example: Fidelity</h1>\n\n<p>When transferring to AST for DRS, first transfer shares to an account you&#39;re not using for your daily buys and sells as these are suspended while the transfer goes through. Fidelity makes it easy to make additional accounts underneath your login. Transfers from a cash account may transfer out quicker than margin.</p>\n\n<p>A uninformed chat bot or rep may tell you you can&#39;t transfer out from margin even if your shares are not out for loan, but this is false. Call the margin department or transfer to a cash account inside Fidelity first. Then you can use the online chat to transfer out. The online chat process is automated after your first AST transfer now I believe.</p>\n\n<h1>Registration</h1>\n\n<p>Shares should transfer to AST within 3 or 4 business days. I&#39;ve heard people are getting their letters in the mail within a week after the Fidelity transfer out (used to be longer). You&#39;ll receive your login info to setup and access your online AST account on the letter. Enter your information exactly as shown on the letter. If you fail your first setup attempt with your letter, stop. Then call customer service for assistance registering by phone. Some reports of people being locked out awhile from multiple failed attempts for security, so if you fail once call.</p>\n\n<h1>International Apes</h1>\n\n<p>Holy shit you guys need a Discord channel or a sub to help the less knowledgeable. I&#39;ve heard everything and in between.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

It&#39;s nothing to regain compliance which is the procedure to regain from expert. BBB filed their 8k this morning. A big beefy burrito. At least in this instance, a company listed the 211 filing to move up to pink limited from expert on their <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1653821/000143774920001270/0001437749-20-001270-index.htm\">8k</a>. Do you trust Kastin? I think we could be missing a strategic angle here, if the 211 has not been filed (which is on the Finra gated website, so we&#39;d only know via the company informing on their 8k). So obviously the 211 is way easier to fill out then the 8k they submitted. If we don&#39;t regain from expert before a major happening, I think it could be strategic.</p>\n\n<p>The other alternative is that it seems the company would be needing to file an 8k every 4 days for all the financial changes and events happening in a bk which is cost prohibitive. And perhaps the company would abstain from filing the 211 to regain otc out of some threat of a lawsuit that was basically saying the company was making it easier to invest in them without 100% certainty of shareholder recovery. I&#39;m not sure. </p>\n\n<p>The lack of reporting would make any share exchanges many of us speculate the 311 mil at play with, would not be reportable in the typical 4 day 8k required period. Considering theres a hearing on Chapter 11 and companies playing in the grey area or worse here, this could be important to consider. Especially while Cohen is being investigated and sued by several other shady parties.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

PP Show edition (BBBY history 2019)", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>More threads of Marantz and people he cites being so so wrong at the bottom</p>\n\n<p>(image for mobile browsing) <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/BAbvw3L\">https://imgur.com/a/BAbvw3L</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: I misheard /misremember what Marantz spoke about involving his brother so I&#39;ve edited that snippet. See that&#39;s how you do it Marantz. It&#39;s easy.</p>\n\n<p>Back to 2019 -Legion Partners came on shortly after the board put 5 new people on, likely from the threat of Legion shaking things up their way. Before Legion could step in, the board brought 5 new board members on, removing 7, adding only 2 with retail experience. The board even reelected the person in charge of compensation despite they fact she lost the vote. Remember ISS and Glass Lewis Roach suggested could be bought off for the RS vote to be approved ?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/xy0ff8abk1bb1.gif\">https://i.redd.it/xy0ff8abk1bb1.gif</a></p>\n\n<p>The groups Cohen approved in the standstill?</p>\n\n<p>Well Glass Lewis gave the company an F in a pay for performance rating, And ISS gave a 9 out of 10 in riskiness for board structure, and a 10, the max risk score in corporate governance (before Legion came on).</p>\n\n<p>Legion attempted to wipe the board clean and setup a diverse crew with a lot of retail experience. They were only able to get 3 people on - all stayed on while Cohen kicked others off (Schechter, Kirwan, and Gove, Legion&#39;s and the other activist&#39;s picks  stayed). Legion fought for a slew of shareholder rights which were absent.</p>\n\n<p>Legion saw the problem with high paid consultants and sought to save costs there, as well as a problem with the exorbitant pay of then CEO Temares who made over 180 mil, while Bed Bath lost 8 billion in market share and it&#39;s competitors soared. Meanwhile Temares  did 10.6 billion in stock buybacks before Legion entered. And the founders raked in over 60 mil the past 15 years. Sound familiar? I&#39;m not saying all their recommendations were on the money, but from their detailed plan, I think it&#39;s clear the changes they could have made with more board control would have been beneficial.</p>\n\n<p>How about that Legion worked hand in hand with Cohen&#39;s law firm  Olshan  to make changes, while Watchell representing Bed Bath fought them (Elon had problems with Watchtell at Twitter). Yet some how it&#39;s Legion fault for the past problems with Bed Bath now that his Apollo story has lost steam.</p>\n\n<p>Of course Marantz continues to rally about Apollo mentioning it&#39;s different when &quot;you&#39;re a board member of Apollo for a long time &quot;.  Gove was shortly on the board of Fresh Market that was bought by Apollo. But that&#39;s against his thesis of them only bankrupting companies because shareholders actually received a good premium from the buyout. And that&#39;s, like it dude. Of course I&#39;m not trying to speak highly of Apollo either. But he continues to play 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon despite timelines not lining up <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beyond_uranus/comments/12tr97g/marantzs_dingleberries_and_cherry_picking_part_1/\">whatsoever</a> (see the course case example). He also omits much of Gove&#39;s work history that doesn&#39;t come close to fitting his narrative. You know I&#39;m something of a string boardest myself, but at least the players and dates line up, along with real facts and figures.</p>\n\n<p>The only person that&#39;s ever worked directly at Apollo itself, among BBBY GME Dragonfly and Volition, at least that I could find, is at Cheng&#39;s company Volition Capital. In addition, her latest project Jet , received some of their capital raise from Bain. Of course in Marantz&#39;s world this isn&#39;t significant but the fact Kastin worked at Toys R US when Bain bought it in Bankruptcy would be, due to his cognitive dissonance. The fact Fleiss (frmly Apollo /currently Volition) was on the board of Party City as well, that filed for bankruptcy isn&#39;t an issue either. And shouldn&#39;t be on it&#39;s own. Liquidation or restructuring can happen for a variety of reasons, not always nefarious. If people were simply guilty by association, regardless of how much influence one has on the other, we&#39;d all be screwed.</p>\n\n<p>Two of Gamestop (1 now that Furlong&#39;s gone) worked at Amazon. Apparently only private equity is the issue even though he believes in Gmerica and Amazon would be a direct competitor.  Only in Bed Bath&#39;s case or who he decides to pick a fight with is there an issue of association, and usually then, one he often gets wrong. In other instances, his cognitive dissonance will omit things like Cheng and Cohen  working with the largest retail private equity the past couple years (Catterton through Dragonfly). Somehow it must be different there.</p>\n\n<p>And somehow, if Gove did work for Truck Hero, Apollo with less than 10% of the bonds, fits his accusations of  her better so he highlights that. Even though the the fact is, Catterton did a full buyout of them prompting Apollo to get involved at all, through the purchase of some bonds. But that just might make his head explode if he connected those parts of his brain together.</p>\n\n<p>I think the best we can tell him it&#39;s his not his fault. Over and over again until he breaks down like Will from Good Will Hunting, and decides to relay the truth some day.</p>\n\n<p>If you find a mistake and have an actual source I can reference, I&#39;m happy to take a look and admit if I&#39;ve made a mistake. It baffles me that some can&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to read more about how Legion attempted to fix Bed Bath in 2019, you can read here</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189519001117/prec14a09050028_04162019.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189519001117/prec14a09050028_04162019.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Other places Marantz has gotten things very wrong</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/beyond_uranus/comments/12tr97g/marantzs_dingleberries_and_cherry_picking_part_1/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/beyond_uranus/comments/12tr97g/marantzs_dingleberries_and_cherry_picking_part_1/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/11jwzq7/gove_has_a_good_history/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/11jwzq7/gove_has_a_good_history/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/e1mSDZ6Ea0Nc-i15w0sXEYBw8ErGdDzyO4HpZsS8yYM.jpg\"/></div>"},

Likely due to her experience with structuring a large private equity fund at Catterton, Dragonfly&#39;s pals. It looks like even the one Dragonfly got the 500 mil for.  The amended FILO with this  recent 100 mil figure that was renegotiated,  would likely use her services again if she worked on it in Aug. Cohen&#39;s total proceeds also  just  happened to be 50.4% of the $375 mil FILO in Aug (sources in previous posts, will provide if asked).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ln2yg4mdik9b1.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=343d89e76a88324ebf65a6335c421e72c906c282\">https://preview.redd.it/ln2yg4mdik9b1.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=343d89e76a88324ebf65a6335c421e72c906c282</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/tvjr6opiik9b1.gif\">https://i.redd.it/tvjr6opiik9b1.gif</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/YdGlEVr3AkvOse7aqIAy-XH8lNIRu2MIfd27z4T-7bA.jpg\"/></div>"},

It&#39;s either a Spac or it isn&#39;t. There are a number of deals, and a reverse merger is not the same thing as a reverse triangular merger for example. Or the same thing as a reverse morris trust etc. If it&#39;s like a spac in anyway then say how.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The private company in a SPAC transaction takes ownership of a clean shell with no previous history nor operations. There are no potential liabilities associated with past operational activities as there are with dormant shell mergers&quot; - That&#39;s it.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever degree BBBY is involved, it&#39;s not in the terms of &quot;spac land&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The filing that dropped Bobby on Feb 7 dropped hard. Whose to say it would have dropped easier if released at a different time? They dropped it hard on Cohen&#39;s sales news in August hard and fast as well and that was after hours. Someone read the filing enough to make sense of what was occurring from the filing or was it an algo? How can you account for how an algo is going to drop something and how fast? Are you simply not going to file? We&#39;ve heard there were rumors about the filing that made it run up, but then it drops it? Sounds like it. The same market makers that took us up dropped us hard down more than likely. Don&#39;t put that shit on the board.</p>\n\n<p>With representation regularly by Kirkland and Ellis and other top firms, Bobby was going company to company to try and push through something blatantly illegal with the vote? No. Come on.</p>\n\n<p>Late filings was also suggested to indicate fuckery but we know damn well late filings are associated with mergers and acquisitions.</p>\n\n<p>As far as Roach returning again to the bad books argument - Cohen signed off on his 144 which says he didn&#39;t see that.</p>\n\n<p>RC only had right to appoint a board member if he had 4.04% but he didn&#39;t have the ability to buy back in after his sales more than likely. That&#39;s my reading of the standstill. Some other people have made some good points maybe there was some way around this but this hasn&#39;t been proven. Check the warranties section.</p>\n\n<p>We didn&#39;t hardly use up any of the 130 million offering. The first 12 million share offering, 3 million shares were sold for 10 dollars a piece. I wish I had a better understanding of the Pipe offering so I could debate the rest better but to say that the company has done a shit job on each atm is not true. I also don&#39;t get how the secondary transaction of Cohen is not talked about as if its a big piece, and that Cohen&#39;s name is attached to the PIPE. At least as far as Pitch book goes fwiw.</p>\n\n<p>The RS itself is not dilutive. A 10 to 1 going to a 20 to 1 is not dilution. Sorry. Nope. It&#39;s a stock split. The board wants what they need to keep the price from going sub 1.00 or some level that is not good for a spin off or something else. It&#39;s only dilutive in the sense if the authorized shares that remains high is used. It could be dilutitive together with that share count since if you&#39;re right in assuming all those shares would be sold. But remember too that Gamestop had a ton of shares as well to offer and they simply used those to splividend back to shareholders giving them 4 shares for their 1 for instance.</p>\n\n<p>If I give you a dollar for 4 quarters its the same amount. There&#39;s also an assumption that the price will be driven back down to sub 1.00 levels or very low levels and then another offering would be done, then needing another RS without a major news event like a spin off. Which is likely one of the reasons for the RS in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t you need to be above a certain price just to be bought by certain major indexes? If this stock is manipulated as much as many of us think (130 mil marketcap come on) then how fast could they drive it back down outside of the requirements of some managed funds to keep shares from being locked up there? If I&#39;m wrong, tell me If I&#39;m wrong. If the market makers/ shf whoever are keeping the price suppressed, then this is the option you have to allow being bought again by certain funds, as well as making the spin off seem more appealing and representative of the quality of the spin off you&#39;re doing. If you catch my drift.</p>\n\n<p>The company didn&#39;t threaten bankruptcy. They said they may need to file for bankruptcy protection without the RS (Chapt 11 reorganization). How does a company raise money? Share offerings. The company is responding to peoples complaint that they&#39;ve sold shares for shit prices (at the times they have). Which way do you want it?</p>\n\n<p>Lawsuit or no, Cohen said he&#39;d hold BBBY accountable. You think we wouldn&#39;t have a better sense of what he thought if they were royally screwing us over with the standstill being over? Or what about Icahn?? Would Icahn stay silent as well with Westpoint sold there? There&#39;s a small suit about 600k so maybe you&#39;d make an argument that&#39;s the hold up and similarly for Cohen.  But couple with the FACT that Cohen tweeted a meme of Cohen buys all the stocks at with the timestamp of 4.07 when BBBY was trading within the 5 minute candle at 4.07 and you to at that point consider if he&#39;s screwing with us or if he&#39;s with us. His past history speaks for itself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
