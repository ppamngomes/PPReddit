For me, this seems too on the nose and date centric and we all know how bad date predictions go. Plus the connection to the LME or TYO seem too loose in regards to this play. Let&#39;s try a different angle, with more refined powdered tin to huff up. Apologies in advance if this comes off as a string of incoherent ideas that should admit me to an asylum.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This is my interpretation of the code: &quot;44125LondonJapan =&gt; DDAYLondonJapan&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>DDAY is the Normandy Landings during WW2. London(aka Great Britain) and Japan were major players in WW2. WW2 also connects the Jewish relationship that popped up in past DD regarding Yom Kippur. DDAY is also know as Operation Neptune. Neptune is <em>beyond</em> Uranus in planet order. </p>\n\n<p>DDAY was a joint surprise attack by the Allies on the German foothold in Europe that started from the shores of Great Britain. Japan also had their own surprise attack in the war as Pearl Harbor. Japan has also underwent shock at their own quick surrender with two atomic bombs drops and in a months time a swift surrender, much to the surprise of most of their citizens. I think this code is to relay the theme of a &quot;surprising&quot; end this saga may go through. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Japan had suppressed the news of the destruction by the first atomic bomb from most of their population. It was only when Truman announced the bad news did it become public. I liken this to the long awaited announcement to say publicly that shareholders are preserved because the shorts would know the allegory &quot;bomb&quot; of their schemes had already done the damage. Right now is the suppression period. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading my tinfoil.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I thought shortsellers win by never closing shorts to avoid taxes)?
