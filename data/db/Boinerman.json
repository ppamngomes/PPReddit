A wrinkle has formed! THE LOOMING PIVOTAL MOMENT! \ud83d\ude80\u23f0", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Guys I think\u2026 I think I just gained a wrinkle. I think I understand what\u2019s going on here. Feel free to lay down your thoughts about it too.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m pretty regarded and eat crayons so take it fwiw. This is all theory and speculation.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about the IP\u2019s being sold and basically bbbyq having essentially what shills keep saying\u2014\u201cnothing left for shareholders\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>This is all part of the plan imo. I believe what\u2019s going on is RC and Icahn have laid the biggest bear trap in history to fund Teddy. </p>\n\n<p>Chapter 11 was the greatest move they could\u2019ve done to protect bbby from shorts. You see in Chapter 11 bbbyq got onto the OTC off of the major exchange and took away much of their manipulation abilities. Can they still manipulate the stock? Yes, not near as much though. I believe RC and the bbby board rushed the company into chapter 11 because he knew the whole basket stock theory was resting on what happens with bbby. I\u2019m sure most of you all are following up to this point and are already aware of this. </p>\n\n<p>So chapter 11 gives RC the ability to activate his trap card whenever he deems fit. </p>\n\n<p>Yes, timing here is going to play a key role in this whole saga. </p>\n\n<p>You see the global economy is tinkering on the brink of collapse and with it we know that the meme stocks will soar to the moon. Especially, bbbyq. </p>\n\n<p>The M&amp;A lawyers and RC are probably waiting for this pivotal moment to reveal their final plan. </p>\n\n<p>So why did I bring up the lack of assets and IP available to bbbyq and shareholders at the beginning of my post?</p>\n\n<p>Well, because getting rid of leases allows them more wiggle room for timing the pivotal moment in the looming global financial crisis. They no longer have to pay for those leases and have extremely low overhead and funding loss. They can always amend the plan and get these leases back at any moment as far as I understand. (Correct me if I\u2019m wrong). So if this is the case it basically allows the stock to cruise into that pivotal moment.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, RC had placed the IP in the hands of Overstock. A company that is a short destroyer. Lol, seriously? That has to be something imo. I believe Overstock is simply holding onto the IP until the pivotal moment. That way HF\u2019s can\u2019t get their dirty hands on it and mess things up. I think the same could be said for Dream on Me. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of this is speculation, tinfoil and an interpretation of how I see everything lining up with all the event up until this point. I\u2019m not sure how this will all play out, but it\u2019s my theory that everything is being intentionally pushed out.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR; I believe RC is purposefully pushing out the final plan to time it with the looming financial crisis AKA Volmageddon 2.0. I also believe the M&amp;A lawyers gave the IP rights away temporarily (imo) to Overstock and Dream on Me. Furthermore, it\u2019s my theory that the leases were sold/rejected to reduce overhead and expenses to give bbbyq more wiggle room on time and financial stability.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
