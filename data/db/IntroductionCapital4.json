I didn\u2019t have problems with the webull account, until now. Last week I initiated a full account transfer from webull to my fidelity account. Everything in the account has been moved over except 4 \u201cmeme\u201d stocks. What do these stocks have in common? They have all been borrowed by shorts. What are the chances these will be settled and moved over to Fidelity before sept 12th?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff4500"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/FdLyG5SqnBN9K2o7IvPOaZ9synCqxTXqFaPEj0wh3V0.jpg\"/></div>"}]
