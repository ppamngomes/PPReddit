The SEC has the power to enforce its rules by instituting enforcement actions against a delinquent issuer and/or its officers and directors seeking monetary or other penalties, including revoking the issuer\u2019s registration pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act6. In the absence of egregious and/or repeated violations, or inferences of fraud, however, the SEC is more likely to rely on the stock exchange(s) to police listed companies. Section 1002(d) of the NYSE Amex\u2019s Company Guide7, for example, permits the exchange to suspend trading or delist a company\u2019s securities altogether for failure of the company to file its quarterly annual reports. The OTC Bulletin Board8 has a more specific \u201cthree-strikes\u201d rule, FINRA Rule 6530(e)9, that prohibits the OTCBB from quoting the securities of any issuer that is delinquent in its reporting obligations three times in a 24-month period.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: nothing can happen for potentially 2 years in the OTC market.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
