I started looking at their website, in their About Us section, there are references to listening closely to what our customers need. There is also \u201cLike our relentless and unwavering focus on QUALITY AND SAFETY. These two values form the bedrock of our company.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Then, when you look at their family of brands, they have Evolur Baby, Sweetpea Baby, TailZzz, Hannah &amp; Sophia and Slumber Baby. When you look at each of their family of brands websites, we have the following.</p>\n\n<p>SweetPea Baby was created to fulfill a desire amongst today\u2019s parents for safe, superior quality baby furniture. Our range of products and nursery collections speak to creative and fashion forward parents who place an emphasis on safety, quality construction and on-trend designs.</p>\n\n<p>Hannah &amp; Sophia, \u2013 a proud, USA-born company, committed to transforming the lives of parents &amp; children with award- winning, high-quality, eco- conscious and safe products for 30+ years. From catering to parents &amp; pet parents,\nSlumber Baby, We operate on a deep commitment to bringing the safest and best quality nursery furniture that provides families with an unquestionable value-for-money.</p>\n\n<p>TailZzz, Born out of the love for all things furbabies, TailZzz understands that today, a pet parent is more than just a pet\u2019s \u2018hooman\u2019... they\u2019re an animal\u2019s PAWrent, who wants nothing less than the best for their fur babies. Keeping this emotion and need in mind, TailZzz creates carefully designed, high-quality and safe products for furbabies and parents, everywhere!</p>\n\n<p>Evolur Baby, Our designs take into consideration all aspects of the product \u2013 the parts with the whole, their intended function, performance and safety.</p>\n\n<p>Now, where the tinfoil comes in, is the multiple references to safe and safety. Maybe this is where RC\u2019s tweet \u201cChildren and animals must be protected at all costs\u201d comes into play? Again, just some lazy tinfoil on a Sunday afternoon.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
