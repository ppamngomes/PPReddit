They ended up right for not allowing BBBY posts on the Stonk sub after all now that it&#39;s definitive that this dead stock has absolutely nothing to do with GME. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of slander was lobbed toward GME apes like Platinum or Pink, OGs like GMEDD &amp; DOMO and SS as a whole.  The group around this stock began disregarding core ape tenets such as not idol worshipping, critical analysis of DD (not just confirmation bias) and not allowing grifter/youtuber elements to seep through. The current shitshow state of BBBY shows why those maxims were worth adhering to. </p>\n\n<p>Now PP is shifting this sub to be about GME and IEP to continue his show. ( \ud83d\ude12 ) All I wanna know is who is man enough to apologize for the obnoxious and unnecessary insults to well meaning apes who didn&#39;t let this bad play get shilled on other subs or was calling a spade a spade the entire time. Apologies for folks who got downvotes for truthfully stating Icahn had nothing to do with GME or BBBY. And for people who rightfully criticized the trash tier DD based on Teddy books, tweets and random Icahn shit. </p>\n\n<p>I know its highly unlikely to get one but it needed to be said anyway</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
