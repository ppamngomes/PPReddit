Pre-shipment was Nov 03, it was accepted in METRO NY DISTRIBUTION CENTER on Nov 04, departed on Nov 05, and expected delivery on Nov 06 (tomorrow). </p>\n\n<p>Now, I get a decent amount of mail from Broadridge (you might too), they are a financial services company (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadridge_Financial_Solutions\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadridge_Financial_Solutions</a>), but these mailers are usually sent as presorted first class or below. The fact that this is being sent priority and with tracking information has me quite intrigued. </p>\n\n<p>I held $BBBY shares (expired), options (canceled), and bonds (all three dates). Could be related to the on-goings with $BUTTFQ or completely unrelated. I&#39;ll know more tomorrow<sup>TM</sup>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
