From what we know it was a bid for $500M in debt relief for what I believe was for the entire company. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. \n\nWhat I would like to get your opinions/thoughts on is the following:\n\n- What do you think (or know) they intend to do with BoBBY if their bid was accepted? Were they continuing as a going concern? Sell for parts? \n- Were they taking on all debt/liabilities in this deal? \n- Why is their bid not being serious considered but instead we\u2019ve been accepting much lower bids for the IP? \n\nLike most things with this play over the last 6-12 months, there are a lot of question marks and/or just odd decisions being made by the BOD/BoBBY legal team. Leads me to believe they might have something interesting cooking, but I can\u2019t help but also sometimes worry that the reality could be much different. \n\nI haven\u2019t seen this question seriously discussed so please share your thoughts. \n\n\n(Also feel free to x-post in the main sub if you have the karma to do so and if you think a wider discussion would be more helpful!)", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
