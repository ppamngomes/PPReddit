Whether it\u2019s a foreign adversary or it\u2019s own people in the most disingenuous way. It is not a government that seeks equilibrium but a centralized regime that seeks to control everything. I\u2019m sure we all know this by now, but what I want to iterate is how important a role we play in all of this. Shills or misinformed individuals come to this sub and say whatever they think is right knowing they don\u2019t know shit about fuck.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m telling you right now as someone who\u2019s been here for a while that this was never about the money. This is about power. Power, power and more power. Any price target you have is practically null &amp; void. These guys wouldn\u2019t still be shorting if this was about the money. I don\u2019t really like saying much often but if you know you know. This stock will be ABSOLUTELY unobtainable &amp; practically priceless. I don\u2019t know how much longer it might take but My God will it be glorious.
