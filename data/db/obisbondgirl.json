I happened to scroll all the way to the bottom banner and on the right it said \u201cDividend FAQ\u2019s\u201d. See attached picture. I notice this DOES NOT appear on the bottom banner on my phone, pc only.</p>\n\n<p>The first time I clicked the FAQ, it took me to investors.overstock.com/events. The most recent item was Overstock\u2019s Q3 2023 Earnings Call on Oct 23. I did not see any dividend FAQ\u2019s like I expected.</p>\n\n<p>I tried again &amp; went back to the homepage, clicked the FAQ link. This time it took me to <a href=\"http://www.bedbathandbeyond.ca/dividends\">www.bedbathandbeyond.ca/dividends</a>. However it was talking about Overstock authorizing a dividend in 2020. I was confused because that is not current. The page would not let me scroll &amp; said I had an invalid browser. I wish I took a picture, very sorry. I hit refresh &amp; now I can\u2019t get back to it. It also does not show up on my browser history. I know what I saw though &amp; took note of the URL.</p>\n\n<p>I hope it is ok to share, I wish I had better proof. But I\u2019m sure smarter folks here can make something of it. Thanks for reading.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/o7mbdej7lkyb1.jpg\"/></div>"}]
