They have been taking much longer than usual and I\u2019ve been calling daily to check. </p>\n\n<p>So I log on today to check again, and I see this absurd loss of $38k listed in my account. I bought almost all OTC and never spent <em>anywhere near</em> that amount in the first place, so I know it\u2019s wrong. I called to check on why the cost basis/loss is totally out of whack. They said it was related to the DRS \u201cjournaling\u201d between margin and cash status (eg fake to real shares) and their \u201cback office\u201d team is investigating it.</p>\n\n<p>So, it\u2019s a glitch.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s my theory: my DRS request was placed before the judge\u2019s final order and subsequent move to EM. So they have to buy \u201creal\u201d shares now no matter what. And as they\u2019re doing that, they\u2019re paying to acquire real shares off the EM since the ticker price is apparently some bs. So, thus far, they\u2019ve bought $38,000 worth of shares and recorded <em>their</em> loss on it, not mine. They still haven\u2019t fulfilled the DRS request despite my calls all week. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re having trouble with locates for real shares. </p>\n\n<p>Probably nothing. I\u2019m probably wrong. NFA of any kind. You do you. See you at Uranus my frens</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/21jngcs34hob1.jpg\"/></div>"}]
