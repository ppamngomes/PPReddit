If we get a cash buyout before then, I would just expect the options to be adjusted to the buyout price. </p>\n\n<p>This sounds like to me we would need news before 10/20, otherwise all those options become worthless. </p>\n\n<p>But what if there is also equity involved in the buyout??? What happens??? Do they still expire 10/20??? Do they adjust to the ticker price, whatever it is, on 10/20?????</p>\n\n<p>I would imagine that if carl or Rc (or both) are actually involved, they would pull the trigger before these options are set to expire, otherwise it lets a bunch of shorts off the hook, and apes in no mans land for any options they own. Anyone want to add/correct/ any further input????</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
