This suggested to me that there may have been a significance to the number of pages. After ordering the four of the books from Amazon (sorry RC I don\u2019t have any Teddy.com credit card points) I can confirm that if you only count the glossy pages the total number of pages is 16, if you do count the first and last page of each book, then each book has 18 pages.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I would like to take this chance to apologize for any antisemitic remarks or jokes I\u2019ve made toward anyone, even those not of the faith. I promise to be a better man going forward. Although until the day has come to pass that we have won, I will always be tired of the corruption and unfair practices undertaken by Wall Street.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck to us all,</p>\n\n<p>Till Valhalla</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
