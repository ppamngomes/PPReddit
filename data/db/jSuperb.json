Told me my shares were worthless and that if something were to happen in the future (though highly unlikely) I can prove ownership by going to my P/L showing I had shares. I\u2019m totally fine with this response and wasn\u2019t expecting to hear anything \u201cunique\u201d  from the rep, I then asked if I could get what I was just told in writing via email so I could have a paper trail just in case something did happen and my claim to those shares couldn\u2019t be disputed.(This was my only objective for the call) I was told that was a \u201csomewhat outlandish request\u201d and that \u201cmy supervisor said he is not going to do that for you, and that I can get it myself by going to the P/L and downloading the official Fidelity statement.\u201d I again expressed concern of why I couldn\u2019t get what I was just told in writing via email so there can be no dispute in the future and requested to speak to a compliance officer if they couldn\u2019t accommodate my request. I was again told no and also denied being transferred to a CO because \u201che didn\u2019t have a phone number for them.\u201d The last thing I want to be is difficult or rude to these reps as I know they know nothing more than us, and are just people trying to do their jobs. But is this not shady behavior? I\u2019d like to hear y\u2019all\u2019s opinions. As someone who\u2019s been in sales/ finance manager for car dealerships this is pretty standard practice and  it threw up some red flags for me. Appreciate y\u2019all\u2019s help!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83c\udf49 Watermelon Lover \ud83c\udf49 ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
