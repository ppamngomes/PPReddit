Pre RS, my total potential gains would be 10.000 x 30 = 300k. However if the same squeeze is going down post RS, my gains would only be 1000 x 30 = 30k. In order to get the same amount of gain pre RS (300k) in my case, I would need the stock to squeeze to at least $300 per shares with my 1000 shares, which idk how likely that would be.\n\nSo it seems that at any given price target, the potential gain is going to be less post RS vs pre RS since everyone's share count is reduced by a factor of 10,\n\nAm I thinking this right or am I being regarded?", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
