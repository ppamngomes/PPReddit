Once I told them I had BBBYQ, they asked for the last 5 digits of my social.  The rep, Mike, said that he was still able to see my shares and they were still there.  He said they are not showing up the normal way, so they have to use a back door to pull up and see them.  He told me they were still all there and basically in limbo until they receive further instructions.  He said once AST receives instructions, shares will be moved to where ever they need to go and AST should send out a letter informing clients, as well as the new transfer agent should send a letter letting clients know their account number for the new transfer agent and all pertinent information.  So in conclusion, I was not able to sign into AST but my shares are still their and all is good.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Stream announcement ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

If you have not gotten any shares of towel, it\u2019s too late.

People will want some towel this week but you can\u2019t get it anywhere (even from moo moo).  Now FOMO will possibly hit for GME when people realize they can\u2019t get towel, they will try jump on board with another \u201cmeme\u201d stock.  And after doing some digging and seeing the awesome financial shape GME is in, they will try jump on board that.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
