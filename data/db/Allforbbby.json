A San Francisco-founded payments technology company that has provided a profitable exit for its market leading VC investors, while also making strategic acquisitions. A New York-based life sciences company which raised $50m and less than two years later successfully dual listed on Nasdaq. Each one of them has successfully raised funds from blue-chip investors during the COVID pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>They have one thing in common. They are all listed on London\u2019s public markets.</p>\n\n<p>For growth-hungry North American CEOs seeking to use the capital markets to build billion-dollar-plus businesses, a London IPO could well be your optimal route.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nbmcc63p4ieb1.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8688f5641396e11643fbe200b0aa333c7fc3b770\">Looking at all the options?</a></p>\n\n<p>First, let\u2019s deal with four\u00a0big and common misperceptions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The US perception:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You need to be a unicorn to IPO.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The UK reality:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Simply not the case.</p>\n\n<p>On AIM you can IPO at a significantly smaller size compared to the US markets. In recent years, the average market capitalization of an AIM company at IPO has been $120m, compared to nearly $1bn on Nasdaq[1].</p>\n\n<p>And AIM provides rich soil from which smaller companies can grow in scale and value. London can even provide a platform for a US company to raise capital and execute a US listing when it has achieved greater scale. (Just read the growth stories below).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The US perception:</strong></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s too expensive to become and remain a public company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The UK reality:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nobody is saying that the process is cheap but the comparison between London and the US exchanges will get your CFO excited. The costs of executing and maintaining a stock market listing is typically much lower in London. Underwriting fees, for example, will typically be 3-5% in London compared to 6-7% in the US[2].</p>\n\n<p>And the ongoing cost and time of quarterly reporting? London mandates half-yearly reporting, therefore reducing the reporting burden on companies and allowing them to focus on longer-term objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s also get your General Counsel excited. The litigation risk is lower in London. Take a look at 2019 \u2013 in just one year 8.9% of all US exchange listed companies were sued. Securities litigation against UK listed companies is simply far less frequent with just three class actions since 2010[3].</p>\n\n<p><strong>The US perception:</strong></p>\n\n<p>IPO under-pricing has become the norm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The UK reality:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lack of certainty about valuation is much less of a factor in the UK. That\u2019s because the UK has superior price discovery mechanisms throughout the IPO process, enabling management teams and their advisers to get feedback from investors from the start and to better understand the likely valuation outcome. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>A big IPO \u201cpop\u201d is not a feature of a London IPO. Since the start of 2017, for IPOs larger than $10m in size, there has not been a single UK IPO which \u201cpopped\u201d more than 50% on the first day of trading, by contrast, in the US, there have been 174.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The US perception:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Liquidity and access to capital only lies in the US markets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The UK reality:</strong></p>\n\n<p>London offers North American growth companies the opportunity to efficiently raise repeat long-term capital from international and UK domestic institutional investors. List in London, and you are accessing capital from across the world.</p>\n\n<p>London has more international companies than any other major exchange. It raised 30% of all the world\u2019s cross-border IPO capital in 2019. It stands head and shoulders as Europe\u2019s largest exchange. In H1 2020, there have been 342 follow-on transactions on London Stock Exchange, raising about $28bn[4]. That represents three times more transactions and three times more in IPO and follow-on proceeds than the next most active European exchange.</p>\n\n<p>This depth and scale of capacity means that companies can finance ambitious growth strategies with long-term, repeat capital raisings. It also means that pre-IPO investors can sell down their stakes both at IPO and in the aftermarket even for growth companies. London-listed US-based companies such as Boku, Polarean Imaging, Diversified Gas &amp; Oil, Renalytix and MaxCyte all raised follow-on capital during the current COVID-19 crisis.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rcetzu564ieb1.png?width=209&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37a44f508ba62e44e3bf480aa1b107425bc5b6fd\">Covid -19 also provided opportunity against the tide</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Three growth stories</strong></p>\n\n<p>So there is ample evidence of the high levels of investor and analyst receptivity in London relative to North America towards companies with valuations between $50m to $1bn.</p>\n\n<p>This environment has enabled a number of exceptional North American businesses to scale rapidly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AIM: a gateway for North American companies back to the US capital markets</strong></p>\n\n<p>For some North American businesses, London has provided the capital to grow and gain critical mass before achieving a dual listing on a US exchange. There are good recent examples.</p>\n\n<p>Take RenalytixAI, a developer of artificial intelligence (AI) enabled clinical diagnostic solutions for kidney disease headquartered in New York City. From its inception, the strategy was to develop RenalytixAI as an independent company and take it to the public markets. While its business model was focused initially on commercialization with large US healthcare systems, much of the cornerstone financing came from UK institutional investors. Its IPO took place in November 2018 on AIM raising $29m with a market capitalization of $81m.</p>\n\n<p>For RenalytixAI, AIM was an attractive option for numerous reasons. It provided a broad institutional shareholder base and the capacity to raise sufficient capital for its product development, with all the corporate governance and reporting disciplines of the public markets. Unlike the capital structures of VC-backed companies, the shareholding structure was clean and simple.</p>\n\n<p>The company was able to return to the market to raise a further $17m in July 2019, bringing in other significant institutional investors and providing plenty of runway to execute without having to be concerned about external political or market factors.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020 RenalytixAI announced its plans for a dual listing on Nasdaq and raised $85.1m in July 2020 and now has a market capitalization exceeding $500m.</p>\n\n<p>So, can you see where we are going here?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7dm4114f4ieb1.png?width=329&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22bfaa8efd37dc75031aac24b3cd26adb2bd788a\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/7dm4114f4ieb1.png?width=329&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22bfaa8efd37dc75031aac24b3cd26adb2bd788a\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Achieving a sell-down for Silicon Valley VC investors and also securing follow-on finance for strategic acquisitions</strong></p>\n\n<p>An IPO for a VC-backed tech firm with a sub-$1bn valuation is a rarity in the US. It\u2019s hard not being a unicorn.</p>\n\n<p>But San Francisco-founded Boku, a world leading independent direct carrier billing network, has shown how a US-based company can go public in London and deliver an exit for its VC investors while also scaling up through acquisitions.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in 2008, it had previously raised $87m in six funding rounds with VCs including Andreessen Horowitz, Benchmark, Index, Khosla and NEA.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>While the management team of Boku saw an IPO as the most effective way of balancing the interests of many stakeholders, the company was not large enough to list on Nasdaq. A London listing provided the way forward and raised the profile and coverage of Boku - the future of payments.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8969pfwk4ieb1.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f039340e8de034797a9adabe3a746fb561ea8b7\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/8969pfwk4ieb1.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f039340e8de034797a9adabe3a746fb561ea8b7\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Its IPO on AIM over three years ago was unusual by US standards; approximately two-thirds of the $59m deal size was a sell-down by VC investors, enabling partial cash exit at the point of IPO. Another accelerated sell-down occurred ten months later and the VCs have continued to monetize their stakes so that none remain significant shareholders. All this for a company with less than $25m of annual revenue, negative EBITDA and a market capitalization below $175m at the time of IPO.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Boku has also been able to issue new shares to fund two strategic acquisitions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Raising capital for an acquisition-led growth strategy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since its IPO, Alabama-based Diversified Oil &amp; Gas (DGOC) has executed 11 acquisitions for a total value of $1.8bn and five follow-on primary equity capital transactions raising a total of around $785m. In 2020, the company has stepped up from AIM onto London\u2019s Main Market. Its market capitalization has soared from $86m at IPO to just over $1bn.</p>\n\n<p>Why did this conventional natural gas and crude oil producer in the US Appalachian basin list in London? For one, its focus on conventional oil and gas was out of favor with US investors, whose gaze was fixed on shale. Besides, DGOC was sub-scale for the US markets. In London, though, the company has been able to tap into high-quality institutional pools of money to enable it to grow at scale and pace. </p>\n\n<p>Many North American founders, management teams and VC investors have preconceptions about what makes an IPO feasible, particularly when it comes to the size of the business. The successful IPOs in London of North American companies shatter these preconceptions. In London, you don\u2019t have to be a unicorn to IPO. There is deep liquidity in London and access to high-quality institutional capital at an earlier and smaller size range than in the US \u2013 and usually at a lower cost. A London listing can be the springboard for your growth ambitions and, as these success stories show, that\u2019s no misconception. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s just remind ourselves what was registered on 12 May in the UK [Ok, and other places, but...] - TEDDY in the UK - <a href=\"https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003910897\">https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003910897</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eeesvnym5ieb1.png?width=1661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a0779348a2f807bf3eb6fc04a7cc19b1fecb75a\">Interested in a cup of tea RC?</a></p>\n\n<p>So, last but not least....</p>\n\n<p>As a final point, the &#39;founder&#39; <a href=\"/u/realpulte\">u/realpulte</a> hinted towards  - could it be this man, Len Bavatnik - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Blavatnik\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Blavatnik</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/526ezy018ieb1.png?width=267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff99da68daa26ec092f7017f847c6fee2574c73e\">Can I come on the PP Show?</a></p>\n\n<p>Sir Leonard Valentinovich Blavatnik is a Ukrainian-born American-British business magnate and philanthropist.

He and others needed BK.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, they can now be offered some lovely new shares [DRS/registered/poss NFT] in our lovely <strong>TEDDY</strong> - NFA as always.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hcidrfnyh59b1.png?width=194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=672cebff3dd6a661089b5f6084a1887bdb6dee7f\">Kissy Kissy Jakey Boy</a></p>\n\n<p>The argument here is that  the UBG could be offered equity rather than cash. Which, if the new company moves to a new CUSIP/reissue, they definitely don\u2019t want. </p>\n\n<p>Remember, a CUSIP change not means shorts are &quot;terminated&quot; (not closed) - I think it is important not to confuse shares that are short and the bonds in this instance [it is easy to get them intertwined in thought].</p>\n\n<p><strong>A new CUSIP will see the short shares, if not closed, just stored on the balance sheet and accumulating interest to be paid/for payment.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this instance, if the theory that the UBG are holding the bonds in a BK/CDS play - the last thing they want is a new CUSIP, because in this situation they are co-dependent. The CDS relies in a specific CUSIP against the bond.</p>\n\n<p>The paper by JF analyzes the effectiveness of hedging a defaultable bond, that may not be at par, with a credit default swap (CDS) by quantifying the variance of the hedging errors and determining the optimal hedge ratio. <strong>Meaning that there is a point where he bond will not benefit the CDS if it drastically changes in value, or fails to get paid - this is the point that the UBG do not want equity replacement - the CDS fails.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The static hedging framework uses bond recovery and time to default, which are correlated, to calculate the variance of the hedging errors and the optimal hedge ratio for the bond-CDS trade. The results show that there are irreducible risks when hedging a defaultable bond with a CDS; these irreducible risks increase with the magnitude of the premium/discount of the bond and decrease as the correlation between default time and recovery increase. <strong>Meaning that the default time has passed [which, if Greasy Glenn had got his motion passed wouldn&#39;t have happened - the UBG need BK for this to work].</strong> The results also show that the optimal hedging ratio was closer to the bond price than the par value of the bond.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qmi66qgyi59b1.png?width=376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8dcdb3a0b253244ffbdf31f665315f19671eb23\">Looking straight down the barrel Jakey?</a></p>\n\n<p>The re-issued equity would likely be in a new company - new cusip means the CDS does not work. The attempted CDS fails on the short side [stuck on balance sheet] and fails on the bond side [due to re-issue with new terms/dates etc or via equity].</p>\n\n<p>I would suggest that JF was hoping to make about $500 million via the CDS [which is the approximate amount he offered for BABY last year] - it was another failsafe for the CDS and the overall &#39;scheme&#39; - the company would have failed and he would have walked away with this &#39;amount&#39; whatever the outcome - multiple profitable exits.</p>\n\n<p>Ch11 and the Judge not allowing the motion has now theoretically &#39;trapped&#39; him from all angles - in theory, the only way out for him to retain a positive outcome is to take on BABY as a going concern.</p>\n\n<p>But, as we know, the main &#39;agitator&#39; is only holding $140million in the bonds [from the court hearing]. Which means he would/they would have to beat the offer coming from 6th street for the &#39;going concern&#39; - this would ultimately leave him well out of pocket - and achieve the exact opposite of the desired outcome - BK. He would have to give them the money needed to stabilise and absolutely avoid BK [BK at this point , imo, is completely off the table].</p>\n\n<p>If he is left with the equivalent to his par bond value - this could possibly be less than what he purchased them for - or, worse - that value of shares in the equity company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See my post here:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/148ayls/is_this_jake_freemans_last_grasp_for_freedom/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/148ayls/is_this_jake_freemans_last_grasp_for_freedom/</a></p>\n\n<p>As it stands bondholders are powerless unless they are part of a bid, or the investment forms part of a bid, remember ch11 prevents hostile takeover</p>\n\n<p>Also see: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/12osy7i/is_the_answer_in_the_bond_exchange/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/12osy7i/is_the_answer_in_the_bond_exchange/</a> - I think the reason for the constant extension to this process has now become apparent - he simply kept saying &#39;no&#39; - and we all know what happens next</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which, is why I still stand by my thesis</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/137ljut/are_we_going_to_get_taken_private/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/137ljut/are_we_going_to_get_taken_private/</a> -</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final prediction</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We get taken private via auction as outlined above.

His ambulance chasing, enchilada smothered, little bearded face just gurning out from behind the camera.</p>\n\n<p>But, what do they want? - They want disclosure and plenty of it. As all parties have eloquently argued to our beloved Judge Papalia - &#39;It is a bit late in the day for all of this, you have had more than enough opportunity to bring this argument and request&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>The key here, is why are they even bothering? This is literally the $2 billion dollar question. </p>\n\n<p>In Chapter 11 cases Investors holding bonds in bankrupt companies [<em>more on this later</em>] can at least have the comfort in knowing that as unsecured creditors they are second in line for payment. Secured creditors, those with claims backed by collateral, such as equipment or real estate, are paid first. Stockholders come last. And that is only if there is any money left after the creditors have been paid.  Chapter 11 allows the corporation to reorganize. Its bonds might continue to trade, but holders will not receive principal and interest payments. As a result, a default could occur, and the value of the bonds might decline significantly. Or the court may approve an exchange of the old bonds for new ones, which could have a lower value. </p>\n\n<p>The key to the requirement for the disclosure is the Unsecured Bondholder Group [UBG] questioning the need for the DIP financing if the monthly sales were in fact very cash flow positive.  UBG are focussing on the statement/projections by Holly Etlin which requested the need for the initial DIP. </p>\n\n<p>See here for the list of documents requested by the UBG -  <a href=\"https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/bbby/Home-DocketInfo\">https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/bbby/Home-DocketInfo</a> - Doc 1115</p>\n\n<p>However, what UBG fail to simply state is that <strong>&#39;projections are simply  that...projections&#39;</strong>. We&#39;ve all seen Shark Tank or Dragon&#39;s Den - projections can be made the other way and greatly exaggerated. Projections are projections - <strong>Holly Etlin is not a pre-cog</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dx21eeqxfr8b1.png?width=350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=132511e7fd3d9116d779f7793dbadd267930501e\">This is not how Holly Etlin will appear in court today</a></p>\n\n<p>This simply does not outline what the UBG are trying to achieve - is the goal to bypass the DIP and send BBBY to Chapter 7? If this is the goal, then our main man Judge Papalia will straight through this. The goal of Bankruptcy proceedings is not to bankrupt a company it is to [chapter 11] save the company and ensure, where possible, that creditors get paid. This is the last [very poor] attempt and crippling our beloved BBBY by the UBG  and sending it spiralling down the Chapter 7 liquidation/bankruptcy route... all together now, on 3 - 1,2,3 - as loud as you can .... &quot;BANKRUPTCY IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>While we are mentioning Judge Papalia:</p>\n\n<p><em>For virtually his entire career, Judge Papalia focused his practice on representing various parties-in-interest in bankruptcy and foreclosure-related litigation and proceedings before federal, state, and bankruptcy courts. He served for many years as a Court-appointed Mediator for the Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey and was Vice-Chair of the District V-A Ethics Committee from 2013 to 2014. He also served as Chair of the Debtor-Creditor Committee of the Essex County Bar Association. Judge Papalia authored or co-authored numerous articles on bankruptcy and creditors\u2019 rights issues and has often spoken on those topics. While in private practice, Judge Papalia was regularly recognized by his peers in various publications listing top-rated lawyers by areas of practice and geographic location.</em>  </p>\n\n<p>This man is top drawer, a master of due process and vastly experienced. I wouldn&#39;t let his mannerism of a man who sneakily watches &#39;Too hot to handle&#39; with a sneaky whisky after his wife has gone to bed - only to fall off the chair fumbling for the remote when he hears her coming down the stairs *Vincent*. This man has overseen a great deal of ch11 cases, and as he directed at greasy Glenn yesterday &#39;Sir, you do know you&#39;ve already been given more than you actually deserve, right?&#39; - he has a steely side and he is nobody&#39;s fool.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fv4kxccbir8b1.png?width=274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eff79c0a51243bc14ac6849f8d3ad77c5038080\">&#39;Vincent - What&#39;s going on down there...&#39;</a></p>\n\n<p>What we have to remember here is that Judge Papalia is fully aware of the details of the DIP agreement and the future details [ie: who is behind the financing and the way it will  play out for the company in the near future]. He is well aware of the positive aspect of this and is simply allowing due process. The &#39;cut off&#39; approach of Sussberg on behalf of BBBY &#39;Your Honor, I want a full trial..&#39; really cut this meandering attempt at bringing failure and ragging this matter through the fields by Greasy Glenn and Jerky Jake to a head.. very quickly.

The request for [and I use this word in the context of the request] &#39;transparency&#39; has been made, as it is alluded that <strong>whatever is &#39;going on behind the scenes&#39;</strong> is being carried out in manner to run down the clock and not allow for any activity on the part of a specific party.</p>\n\n<p>See precedent in:</p>\n\n<p><strong>J. Caiazzo Plumbing and Heating Corp. v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, 2004 WL 2848548 (S.D.N.Y. December 9, 2004</strong>), the claimant asserted that the surety should be estopped from arguing that the <strong>statute of limitations</strong> had run because the surety acknowledged the claimant\u2019s claim and represented that they were investigating the claim and then waited for the statute of limitations to expire before denying the claim. The court noted that a claimant can prove estoppel by showing that the surety [in this case it would be BBBY] initiated settlement negotiations in order to \u201clull the claimant into inactivity\u201d until the statute of limitations expired. In addressing the estoppel argument raised by the claimant, the Court observed that New York courts have consistently rejected estoppel claims against a surety when the surety acknowledged receipt of the claim, reserved its rights on numerous occasions, the amount of the claim was always in dispute, and no settlement was ever offered by the surety. The Caiazzo Court noted that the surety never waived its rights under the bond because each letter it sent to the claimant explicitly reserved those rights [In the case of BBBY - enter docket 707 - record of delivery and process]. Further, the surety advised the claimant that it was in the process of determining its position with regard to the claim, but never offered a settlement or otherwise claimed to be in the process of resolving the claim. As a result, the Court held that there could be no estoppel or waiver. <strong>The difference here is that this case was not going through ch11 proceedings - in ch11 proceedings - the issue of disclosure and transparency is at the decision of the Judge. Applying directly to BBBY - the Judge would not have allowed for confidentiality if it was not in the interest of all parties with sound reasoning.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Bond holders are part of the process and not primary to the process. Bond holders will get paid out in line with any purchase agreement, they do not \u2018access confidential information&#39; or, have the right to unless there is an absurd judgement made [not based on facts] - they are  simply in the line of creditors and if the &#39;confidential &#39;  information is not made available at this point - they would be entitled to appeal, but only if the company goes through ch 7 and/or fails to exist and /or bondholders do not get paid out if the entity no longer fails to operate.</p>\n\n<p>Enter docket 707 - confirmation of the date and location that all/any of the available Information has been sent to.</p>\n\n<p>This is confirmation of where certain materials were sent by Kroll. So, nobody can say they have been missed out.</p>\n\n<p>The request by \u2018the group of bond holders\u2019 to have complete access to all material information is completely at the discretion of the Judge now.</p>\n\n<p>The correct answer is \u2018no\u2019 as bond holders are a lien on ch 11 payout. This is exactly why bbby entered ch11 to allow for avoidance of interference. The only parties to have complete access to the information are those that enter a &#39;qualified&#39; bid. further, the &#39;Qualified Bid&#39; needs to be for a specific part of the business and then the party will be given access to those materials. The material information of a rival bid is not accessible to others at this stage - &#39;Stalking Horse&#39; provisions.</p>\n\n<p>Whoever this group are, they are hugely concerned to make a request like this.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing which I would pick up is the term \u2018<strong>glacial pace</strong>\u2019. If the unsecured bond group (is actually RC (titanic tweet)) then the board really is fcked/compromised and this request is for transparency. The flip side, and my view, is that this group is the group including Jake Freeman (and SHF). The SHF now have to sit back and let ch11 run its course (previous release regarding 30 day notice of transfer of shares of over 4.5% holders).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lrg6267g2r5b1.png?width=293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9d406553f02a04c6504e4e6a8a2fd2fc78b16b7\">RC wants this [BABY] and only this</a></p>\n\n<p>If it is the latter (SHF) I would say that they are completely on the ropes and are now out of ammo, exposed in court and racking up the interest on the shares\u2026 also those that originally lent the shares may be asking for them back to close out.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/40pfrks62r5b1.png?width=297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18197e48a6d2694e190bbbd8108e53f7a6046c85\">Naughty boy Jake... Tut tut</a></p>\n\n<p>This is now for the Judge to hold strong, correctly apply the law and see ch11 process through to its correct conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>If no further &#39;Stalking Horse&#39; extension is filed [or another minimal one] then the timeline moves along and it is time for any other bidder to enter the contest and bid. It can be hoped that any rival bid would simply run the overall price up, but, if the Stalking Horse bid floor is high, then any rival bid would not come close [this is a benefit of the stalking horse process, to set the floor].</p>\n\n<p>As it stands bondholders are powerless unless they are part of a bid, or the investment forms part of a bid, remember ch11 prevents hostile takeover.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a spotlight on this with the recent news with the sec and GG, I would suggest the Judge is aware of this\u2026 in fact, this could be his landmark case to \u2018bring all of this into the light\u2019 ( <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/realpulte/\">u/realpulte</a> )</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5x7mni4x4r5b1.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1c9a09b700a64ab46da878238cfd85083a473a6\">UNLUCKY JAKE</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\u2604 Strikes down shills \u2604", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Sy-hpQ0FnlGRTd7BuqviKKisZPwAQtU5qKEY51XGSyc.jpg\"/></div>"},

In 1988, Icahn took TWA private, receiving $469 million in the deal - equivalent to $1.01 billion in 2020. The agreement also meant that TWA would take on $540 million in debt - $1.17 billion in today&#39;s dollars.</p>\n\n<p>In 1991, Icahn sold TWA\u2019s coveted London routes to American Airlines for $445 million. Some believed that the loss of these valuable assets accelerated TWA&#39;s demise. In 1992, TWA filed for bankruptcy. A year later, in 1993, it emerged with 55% of the company under creditor ownership.  Icahn was himself a creditor and was owed $190 million. With TWA desperate to finish business with Icahn, an eight-year agreement was made that gave him the ability to buy select tickets at 55% of the cost. Reselling the tickets on the internet, American Airlines (the future owner of TWA) estimated that $100 million per year was being lost because of the deal with Icahn.  Finally, in January 2001, it was announced that TWA was bankrupt for the third time and would be sold to American Airlines.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9y4aamjnhz4b1.png?width=284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=369ffc2bc694aa5c89dc520ffe976af6630e8acc\">The APPLE doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree</a></p>\n\n<p>Then lets look at &#39;how the apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree&#39; - remember <strong>how Icahn engaged Apple</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Shares are\u00a0criminally undervalued\u00a0and you have all this cash. You should be buying back shares.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And lest we forget ebay and paypal?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Carl Icahn took a big stake in eBay <a href=\"http://recode.net/2014/02/26/icahn-ebay-battle-heats-up/\"><strong>so he could agitate for PayPal\u2019s spinoff</strong></a>. Now that he\u2019s <a href=\"http://recode.net/2014/09/30/ebay-to-spin-off-paypal-with-new-ceos-for-two-publicly-traded-companies/\"><strong>got what he wanted</strong></a>, he has exited eBay altogether.</p>\n\n<p>The confrontational investor disclosed this week that he has sold his stake in eBay but retains nearly 4 percent ownership of PayPal as of the end of September. All eBay investors received an equal number of shares in PayPal when the payments division spun off into its own public company in July.</p>\n\n<p>The move makes sense. Icahn\u2019s reason for pushing for the PayPal spinoff was that he felt the faster-growing payments unit was being undervalued as part of the eBay umbrella company. Indeed, PayPal is now valued at $45 billion compared to $34 billion for eBay. It is growing much faster than eBay and now has more revenue, too&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>As we have read, all  of these plays [and hopefully BBBYQ] fall into his basic investing philosophy:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;My investment philosophy, generally, with exceptions, is to buy something when no one wants it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The next 72 hours</strong></p>\n\n<p>The stalking horse deadline has been extended <a href=\"https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/bbby/Home-DocketInfo\">https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/bbby/Home-DocketInfo</a> doc 665.</p>\n\n<p>I, like many of us, did not a further extension. Especially in light of the comments by Bed Bath counsel at the last hearing, requesting for a slight extension [a week was granted]. However, there is definitely a different feel to the timeframe granted on this new extension.</p>\n\n<p>The extension only allows for one working/trading day, with the weekend in between. I would be <strong>very surprised</strong> if a further deadline extension was granted. The short time frame of the latest extension highlights that the stalking horse procedure is at the last &#39;fur-long&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>We also need to remember that Bed Bath does not have to use the whole extension. The assumption could be that the work has been completed, and the extension is just to allow for a well timed announcement. We all know that if the stalking horse is linked to RC and/or Icahn, the stock lift will be immediate. The way this stock/short interest and other catalysts, a move over $2/5 would likely not be able to be controlled and then we have lift off [nfa]</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zyv96iophz4b1.png?width=268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bd08acf1f9f827d2eae076422911208ebde20ca\">To the moon!</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Reasons to be cheerful over the weekend</strong></p>\n\n<p>- Carol Flaton appointed to the BOD overseeing chapter 11 process [previous connection Icahn via HP proxy battle</p>\n\n<p>- Ryan Cohen listed as an interested party on the court docket</p>\n\n<p>- RC  Ventures named in the mailing list of the court docket</p>\n\n<p>- DIP finance noted in the mailing list in the court docket during chapter 11 is overseen by Sixth streetwhich has connections with IEP</p>\n\n<p>- Icahn being shorted by Hindenberg</p>\n\n<p>- Appointment of Kastin and Eitlin [links to IEP]</p>\n\n<p>- Cheng, Cohen et al - mysteriously exiting their position from Dragonfly</p>\n\n<p>- IEP/GM/Dragonfly having a boatload of capital available for an &#39;unnamed&#39; future acquisition</p>\n\n<p>- Brett Icahn exiting his Newell position at a huge loss</p>\n\n<p>- TEDDY holding trademark announcements</p>\n\n<p>- The $1.6 billion discount/NOLS created by BBBY entering chapter 11 - along wiht lease sale/termination benefits</p>\n\n<p>- Recent MSM pieces naming potential bidders and an &#39;un-named&#39; potential acquirer</p>\n\n<p>- The IEP q10 with confidential treatment [rarely seen]</p>\n\n<p>- Matt Furlong, after a successful spell, ending his tenure with GME and RC taking the helm [in charge of the war-chest] and RC tweeting &#39;not for long&#39; [which, if you say this using your best Carl Icahn impression, sounds exactly like &#39;Matt Furlong&#39;]  - enjoy practicing that one!</p>\n\n<p>- The oddly timed airing of the &#39;Meme King&#39; hit piece on RC</p>\n\n<p>- GME tweeting the stalking horse, exactly at the end of the deadline on 8th June</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important to note</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think it is important to note that the longevity and initial future interest in this play, needs to be strongly attributed to <a href=\"/u/biggysmallzzz\">u/biggysmallzzz</a> and his god tier DD  [library here <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BiggySmallzzz/submitted/\">https://www.reddit.com/user/BiggySmallzzz/submitted/</a> ] and especially <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/ycxkll/bbby_debt_tender_exchange_offer_analysis_part_2/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/ycxkll/bbby_debt_tender_exchange_offer_analysis_part_2/</a></p>\n\n<p>The thing is, he was right.. even though it is yet to transpire.

Non-public information is information that \u201chas not been disseminated in a manner making it available to investors generally.\u201d Information is material if:<br/>\n (i) \u201cthere is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider [the information] important\u201d when making an investment decision, and<br/>\n (ii) the information \u201cwould have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made available.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>In relation to the potential filing of a 10-K/Q, Court filings by the debtor and statements made in court by a debtor raise more difficult issues under Regulation FD. A debtor is required by OUST to make periodic financial filings with the bankruptcy court. These filings include \u201cMonthly Operating Reports,\u201d which provide a variety of balance sheet information regarding the debtor. Since these filings are made on a monthly basis, they provide financial information between the quarterly filings of the debtor\u2019s Form 10-Q statements. In addition, for a variety of reasons, a debtor may be required to disclose important information in other court filings or in statements made to the bankruptcy court during court hearings. These statements could include, for instance, information relating to the overall financial health of the debtor\u2019s business or recent trends in its operations, financial performance, restructuring efforts, or cash position. </p>\n\n<p><strong>If there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider the information important when making an investment decision, then the information will be redacted and made confidential.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is where conjecture, and mildly stating the obvious begins, the list is redacted from the original as the list is now shorter.

If the Debtors do not receive any Qualified Bids (other than the Stalking Horse Bid), the Debtors will not conduct the Auction and will designate the Stalking Horse Bid as the Successful Bid.

Usually, when evaluating whether a Bid is a Qualified Bid, each member of the Selection Committee shall consider whether the Bid adequately addresses the evaluation factors, and apply such weighting and priority to the factors as such member of the Selection Committee deems appropriate in his or her professional judgment.  I am making the assumption that as the bids are submitted to the debtor [BBBY - that it is the board or just the <strong>&quot;Special Committee&quot;</strong> that evaluates any bid made].  <strong>The committee includes Carol Flaton, Pamela Corrie, Jonathan Foster, and Joshua Schechter.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>There is a solid post on the special committee here: [ <a href=\"/u/stategery_22\">u/stategery_22</a> ]  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/137awal/is_there_something_to_this_ad_hocspecial/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/137awal/is_there_something_to_this_ad_hocspecial/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Objection Deadlines.</strong> The deadline to file an objection with the Court to the consummation of the Sale (excluding objections relating solely to the conduct of the Auction or identity of the Successful(s) Bidder other than the Stalking Horse Bidder) is <strong>June 5, 2023, at 4:00p.m.</strong> (the \u201cSale Objection Deadline\u201d). If the Auction is held, objections relating solely to the identity of the Successful Bidder(s) (other than the Stalking Horse Bidder) or adequate assurance of future performance provided by the Successful Bidder(s) other than the Stalking Horse Bidder must be filed with the Court. Any objections not resolved prior to the Sale Hearing shall be argued at the Sale Hearing or such other time as set by the Court <strong>[June 7]</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The important note from this is <strong><em>excluding objections relating solely to the conduct of the Auction or identity of the Successful(s) Bidder other than the Stalking Horse Bidder.</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>Put simply, if there are no other <strong>qualified bids</strong> [These are bids which are agreed by the debtor, as detailed above], then there will be no objection. To object to the sale, you must have a qualified bid. A bidding party can object to the conduct of the auction, but they must have an initial qualified bid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why a new final hearing date?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is pure speculation, but, from experience, if there are no fresh matters to discuss or a court timetable is not due to be fulfilled then an early final hearing date is set.</p>\n\n<p>The 28 May is the &#39;bid deadline&#39;, however, if there are no further qualified bids then the 2 June hearing will not be required/effective [as there is no auction]. The sale hearing can also be moved back, to allow for a consolidated final hearing [again, as there are no other qualified bids/objections relating to the conduct of the auction].</p>\n\n<p>If the 31 May date, is the consolidated final hearing, that&#39;s 16 calendar days - 384 hours - until the gavel is smashed for the last time on proceedings and the outcome will become final and public.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> As always NFA, you do you... but, based on the assumption that the moved final hearing date is possibly a consolidated final hearing date, only one qualified bid has been made [or others have been made but are not deemed qualified bids].

Also, the cohencidence of the &#39;RC buys all stocks&#39; tweet timing. We can all argue the toss on this minutae as much as we want, but we can&#39;t come to a concrete conclusion... I don&#39;t see Tritton on the list [interested part due to pay-out  compensation].</p>\n\n<p>We are still without an actual notice of delisting from NSDAW, although this assumed due to trading OTC currently.</p>\n\n<p>I remain with my original thesis that the plan is for the company to get bought out and taken private at a pre-agreed price per share. Which is why the low/falling share price and other factors - moving to OTC don&#39;t matter.</p>\n\n<p>If as speculated the deal was done in January and has been held up/forced through ch11 - and it is RC behind it, then I feel he would hold true to any initial offer made and accepted rather than spending a fortune on negotiations and reworking documents/face losing the deal completely.</p>\n\n<p>The price per share can only be speculated at, but assuming a market cap of 460,000,000 and a price of about $6/7 per share would offer around $3 billion - [maybe split as $1 billion for BBBY(q) and $2 billion for BABY] - which would fulfil the RC letter point of  -</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot; In the event Bed Bath pursued a full or partial sale of BABY, it could position itself to pay off debt, put cash on the balance sheet and continue reducing its share count, thereby creating significant value for shareholders. Spinning off shares of BABY would be an even more efficient way to transfer value to shareholders. Notably, BABY\u2019s high online penetration would likely ease operational hurdles. We assume Bed Bath and BABY could still have a shared services agreement to maintain an omnichannel experience for customers. &quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Again, the final price can only be speculated at, but we must assume that if it does go to auction then the final price will go up, same in relation to the stalking horse bid - it will set a high value platform to ensure purchasing success.</p>\n\n<p>The recent GME vote in relation Larry and RC and the GME board, would not matter in terms of conflict, if in fact, GME will absorb BABY directly into their functioning [see pinned post on <a href=\"/r/ThePPShow\">r/ThePPShow</a> regarding GME targeting new partnerships].</p>\n\n<p>Negatives approaching:</p>\n\n<p>If we remain on OTC and get taken private at a pre-agreed price per share then following S1 form and take private date there would be a date for shorts to close by. Please review MMTLP and the U3 hault from FINRA in relation to this, as this is exactly what happened with this stock.</p>\n\n<p>The winning bidder does not end up being RC et al [although I doubt it won&#39;t be at this point] - then I think it is game over and it is purely a sell of money making exercise for the purchaser  and very little consideration will be shown to shareholders.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final prediction</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We get taken private via auction as outlined above. The point in RC letter is followed.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Price per share is the equivalent to $6/7. Shareholders receive $2 per share and a 20/1 stock convert of BBBY(q) to GME [or, if the IPO of BBBY is planned behind the scenes $2 per share and a 15/1 stock convert of BBBY(q) to BABY - placing BABY with an initial  IPO of around $15/20].</p>\n\n<p>We have 24 days - possibly 34 days - 816 hours until this is finally concluded... start the countdown.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/flw7nqxgmtxa1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4315ceca76b6ab59be9583b23c39dfce205f4d2d\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/flw7nqxgmtxa1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4315ceca76b6ab59be9583b23c39dfce205f4d2d\"></a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\u2604 Strikes down shills \u2604", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Crr2AM-uyPmN93X7D-7NK2szrLbH_gu8-puhOIWQxMI.jpg\"/></div>"},

The following,  as always, is NFA and is purely my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>We are reaching the end of this saga... but how will it all end? This we are unsure of, but we do have dates to work to.</p>\n\n<p>Nasdaq informed the Company that trading in the Company&#39;s common stock would be suspended at the opening of business on May 3, 2023. That&#39;s next Wednesday, which leaves 7 normal days or 4 trading days until this happens. It is important to note, that this is suspension and not the actual delisting date, and alot can happen between now and then to stop this.   An announcement of an agreed takeover, application to extend or halt the suspension by BBBY or maybe a small squeeze [which would, for most, render the notion of suspension/delisting moot anyway].... or, maybe we could all take this BOBBY over?</p>\n\n<p>The most curious thing about all of this, is the timing. If BBBY knew this was the plan, then why now? Why not string it out further?</p>\n\n<p>I was ignored when I suggested that, like previous announcements, the RS may not actually happen or be rescheduled... well, it&#39;s been cancelled.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote to the BBBY board last week, on Thursday, key takeout from my letter is below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Excerpt from letter</strong></p>\n\n<p>currently in the process of going through a DRS procedure in relation to the shares held by individual retail shareholders. Although not 100% accurate, it is believed that retail investors hold beneficial ownership of over 10% of the company shares. This would place the \u201ccollective retail investment\u201d as a top five shareholder of Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Inc. (\u201cBed Bath\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d).</p>\n\n<p>Retail investors have spent the last 12 months meticulously evaluating and reviewing Bed Bath\u2019s balance sheet, business practice and forward investment strategy. It has been noted that positive moves have been made to improve the business in the past year, however, there remains significant concerns which need to be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>The public letter (\u201cthe letter\u201d) received by the board from \u2018RC Ventures LLC\u2019, dated 6 March 2023, detailed significant concerns in relation to Bed Bath and evidenced disappointing shareholder returns and underperformance across a relevant time horizon. The letter clearly outlines 4 steps which leadership should undertake to improve the performance of the company and increase shareholder value.</p>\n\n<p>It is accepted that Bed Bath has made positive improvements in relation to suggestions made in the letter. There have been clear moves made to \u2018trim the fat\u2019 from underperforming parts of the company and a more simple approach to business dealings undertaken. The pledge made to be \u2018cash neutral\u2019 by Q4 seems to have been acknowledged during the Q2 earnings call. However, it is felt that aside from required SEC filings, communication from the Company to shareholders and \u201ccollective retail investment\u201d is simply not adequate. The current share price stands at $0.34, which is below the same price the Company was listed at late October 1992. </p>\n\n<p><strong>There needs to be more open and frequent communication from Bed Bath in relation to the falling share price and related short interest.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The suggestions are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Implement and commence a more open and informative shareholder communication strategy</strong> \u2013 From our perspective, there is little or no communication with shareholders in relation to forward strategy and declining share price. It is accepted that there is a requirement to undertake work in a diligent and confidential manner. What is not accepted is the lack of consultation with shareholders and in particular \u201ccollective retail investment\u201d. Whilst it is not expected that management publish a detailed strategy \u2018for all to see\u2019, what is expected is direct communication with shareholders via press release in relation to the falling share price. As investors and key stakeholders, at a time when it is noted that short term bankruptcy seems to be \u2018off the table\u2019, positive affirmations of this thesis and recognition by the Company of the current ever declining share price should be clearly communicated.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Overall recognition and calculation of \u201ccollective retail investment\u201d</strong> \u2013 There is currently an active thesis underway in relation to the direct registration of shares (DRS) by retail investors. This has been undertaken by transfer of registration of individual shares to ATST. As a publicly listed company, Bed Bath is able to directly request up to date information in relation to the number of shares which have been subject to DRS. It is kindly requested that the Company make this information public to shareholders, ideally on a frequently updated basis. It is suggested that this information can be communicated via regular press release or via an active counter widget on the investor relation section of the Company website.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Positively undertaking Fiduciary duties in respect of Bed Bath and shareholders</strong> \u2013 In the \u201cletter\u201d, RC Ventures highlighted that a positive path for the Company to pursue would be to \u2018<em>\u2026pursue a full or partial sale of BABY, it could position itself to pay off debt,</em> <em>put cash on the balance sheet and continue reducing its share count, thereby creating significant value for shareholders.\u2019</em> Or to <em>\u2018Evaluate a full sale to a well-capitalised acquirer - \u2026the market is not giving the Company nearly enough credit for BABY\u2019s value. A sale that can lock in a substantial premium for shareholders and provide Bed Bath the flexibility of the private market.\u2019.</em> It has been widely debated that this would indeed be the most positive avenue for the Company to actively pursue. Actioning this suggestion would not only improve and ensure survival of the Company, but would also demonstrate actions being undertaken in the best interests of the company on behalf of shareholders.  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Acknowledgement, clarification and explanation of unexplained events during the last 12 months</strong> \u2013 It is noted that the last 12 months have been a time of great turbulence and unsurety for Bed Bath, this can also be said in relation to \u201ccollective retail investment\u201d. A number of SEC filings have been made in a very short space of time, without further explanation to investors for the reasoning behind the filings. The purpose of filings are by definition self explanatory, however, reasoning and communication to shareholders in light of the ever declining share price is glaringly absent. It is kindly requested that an explanation is made to shareholders via press release, in which an explanation is provided for the recent filings.<br/>\nFollowing the exit of investor Ryan Cohen from his position in the Company during August 2022, a published \u2018co-operation agreement\u2019 (\u201cagreement\u201d) was issued. There is great uncertainty from analysis of the document as to the precise date when the agreement will actually cease to be active and in place. From analysis of the document, the date March 16th 2023 has been suggested as the earliest point of the document ceasing to be in place. Please could Bed Bath communicate this information in a clear way to shareholders via press release, it is kindly suggested that this be done in a timely manner.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is hoped that the current leadership acts with the utmost urgency to address the points raised in this letter and provide absolute clarity to shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it is with this letter, that the board is notified of possible initial plans by \u201cretail investment\u201d to possibly form a together conglomerate, and potentially seek to initiate a hostile takeover of Bed Bath via majority share purchase, should the board not urgently seek to action the above request(s).</p>\n\n<p>3 days later the ch11 hearing has commenced. </p>\n\n<p>Make of this what you will, but, on the last point... before next Wednesday... could we all actually intervene and all of us takeover BOBBY?  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/j75yta4z99wa1.jpg?width=636&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d72796c96d454b7b1cc426426d2a326c71318c50\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/j75yta4z99wa1.jpg?width=636&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d72796c96d454b7b1cc426426d2a326c71318c50\"></a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\u2604 Strikes down shills \u2604", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/e4p81TrSz09CxDLdaotd3Ch-MnjPR5GWYQHrNHKyYmY.jpg\"/></div>"},

I want to put a shout out to my fellow ape [u/Real\\_Eyezz](https://www.reddit.com/u/Real_Eyezz/) for being there for all the ear bending in relation to my theories and tin foil as this has unfolded.\n\n\\- **The price spike on 6 February** \\- I'd suggest this is a large position being bought of the lit market directly. I wonder whether this could have something to do with the third party transfer of RC's stake back when he sold\n\n\\- **The NDA** \\- It is not logical that an NDA would simply be broken by a casual noting of the HBC signatory. Especially without a press release to officially announce this information. If they are not acting as a proxy.. there is another/multiple parties involved here.\n\n\\- **Staff** \\- The executives hired to join the board and legal. Why would they be hired and the deal planned, simply to be an awful deal for shareholders?\n\n\\- **RC Ventures** \\- There is still one of the original RC board members on the board. Would they approve a 'death spiral' deal?\n\n\\- **Bankruptcy** \\- The share price is now lower than when BK was not off the table. Although not definitely avoided, it would be safe to say that BK has now gone for the short term with the deal.\n\n\\- **BABY** \\- This is the [u/biggysmallzzz](https://www.reddit.com/u/biggysmallzzz/) ... If it does all go wrong and Ch11 ends up being the end game - and all of this is for nothing - they still have BABY to seell to balance the books and the accompanying possible share price rise if this happens\n\n\\- **RC is mute** \\- Before BBBY he would tweet 3/4 times a week, now he barely tweets. We all assume the standstill is over - why radio silence?\n\n\\- **New CUSIP** \\- If the RS happens, the unclosed shorts get stored on the old CUSIP and the interest due on those positions will forever be due and need to be paid by the shorts as they cannot be closed.....\n\n[**Ryan Cohen**](https://twitter.com/ryancohen)[**@ryancohen**](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) **Low interest rates may prove to be like easy sex \u2014 tempting but possibly fatal - 12 October 2022**\n\n\\- **Dragonfly** \\- 3 very wealthy men have gone missing without a trace - Cohen, Blake and Cheng have disappeared from the board... and another rich bloke Brett Icahn - Are we to assume that's the end of their business dealings and they have decided on early retirement?\n\n\\- **Very Truly Yours** \\- Maybe something, maybe nothing, maybe commonplace language.
