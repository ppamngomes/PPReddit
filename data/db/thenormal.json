Someone even mentioned a 100% recovery for such class.</p>\n\n<p>Did I misunderstood? Did I get it all wrong? I wonder if anyone could  explain what the actual status is for bondholders, and how you think the situation might evolve for them.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the sharing your opinions.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
