The agent who did the DRS was the most knowledgeable person I have talked to. I asked them why different brokerages are giving people different information and he said because cooperate actions get notified to different brokerages at different times and that none of it is factual it\u2019s all preliminary. He said none of us should put 100% faith into what we are being told until they word\u201cpreliminary \u201c is removed.
