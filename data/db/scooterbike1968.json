He made a post about it. Seemed very genuine. I am sure Shill Team Six can pull \u201cgenuine\u201d off when they are called in, in times of shambles. </p>\n\n<p>That said, what he claims was done is fucked up. I find it hard to believe but he tells a good tale. Certainly one that silence will not rebuke. </p>\n\n<p>Please respond. The accusations are completely contrary to the spirit of this community, and while I could see \u201cover-zealous\u201d Bobbys doing stupid shit in times of excitement and debate, but the leaders of this community need to be held to the highest standard to keep it united. </p>\n\n<p>That higher standard, of course, includes not doxxing.  But it also requires transparent and direct response when accused of such misconduct. </p>\n\n<p>The accusations seemed pretty low on substance when he got to the \u201cproof\u201d but it\u2019s for you guys to drill down on why it\u2019s bullshit. </p>\n\n<p>Because if what BAT is saying is true, that\u2019s not ok.

Nor all of the fucked up shit leading to BBBY bankruptcy. Naked shorting. The CFO. Crime. Ryan Cohen\u2019s involvement; the fact that the Zoom feed is packed. The judge was basically, \u201cRead the fine print\u201d losers. </p>\n\n<p>And only the US Trustee and SEC attorney looking out (sort of) for retail. The SEC guy bumbled through and neither actually made the right argument.  They pulled punches. You can\u2019t foreclose people from exercising a right like the plan does. It\u2019s a substantive due process violation. </p>\n\n<p>So we were the center of attention at the same time everyone was pretending we don\u2019t exist. </p>\n\n<p>Yet, we do. If we are getting wiped out, how is the stock (at the moment) green. Isn\u2019t it worth zero?</p>\n\n<p>So when I think back to yesterday, and the wierd things, like the SEC lawyer going as an aside \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know who\u2019d want to bring a claim\u2026I\u2019m just sayin.\u201d Paraphrased but that was sarcasm. Of course he knew. We are the elephant in the room. Or Voldemort to them perhaps - or some of them. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m hoping the half assed legal argument and judge\u2019s poor reasoning were to just to advance this to the next stage but \u2026 I guess it seemed like Stage 1, yesterday, really was a stage and an act was being put on. </p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re red again but this price (any price) makes no sense if yesterday was bad. Because if yesterday\u2019s hearing was not good for BBBYQ holders, it was \u201cgame fucking over\u201d bad. </p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re green again\u2026.and I did not hear any bell. </p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\ude80</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
