And there is an episode about Armageddon where Noah&#39;s flood is mentioned... (Yea I am not religious nor pushing religion. There are a lot of civilizations with flood myths, just bear with me.) The passage in question is Genesis 7:4 which reads, &quot;<strong>Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made.&quot;</strong> Now I don&#39;t do dates cause I&#39;m married but this sounds like something (current financial market) being completely wiped out and replaced with something (blockchain market) better. It is an extreme reach but idle hands and all that.</p>\n\n<p>While coming here to post I saw the tweet of Pulte saying, &quot;only the young&quot; and something about 305. Well if you go to Genesis 30:5 it says, &quot;<strong>And</strong> <strong>Bilhah conceived, and bare</strong> <strong>Jacob</strong> <strong>a son.&quot;</strong> What the FUCK?!?  TBF this part has a little bit of Polygamy in it so tell your wife&#39;s boyfriend! Seriously Bilhah was a &quot;maid&quot; of Jacob. Not his wife!!!!
