The Debtors have commenced an orderly and <strong>value-maximizing wind down</strong> of their business, while contemporaneously marketing a sale of all or part of their business on an expedited timeline consented to by their prepetition and DIP lenders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two things to take from this imo:</p>\n\n<p>- Shareholders are stakeholders for all intents and purpose, so &quot;all&quot; includes shareholders .</p>\n\n<p>- If the plan was to only liquidate, why would they care so much about a prolonged chp 11? The creditors gets to pick the carcasses so maximing the value would not be of BBBY&#39;s concern.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
