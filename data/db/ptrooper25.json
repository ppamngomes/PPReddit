The address that brought the billion tokens into existence on February 8th 2023 also removed 977,911,183 tokens on May 10th 2023. These dates are pretty significant if you consider BBBY opened February 8th at $3.12 and closed at $2.61 with a massive volume spike in the days leading up. May 10th was also the date BBBY lawyers requested authorization to get shareholder information itself, instead of relying on the info from Cede &amp; Co. (Your numbers suck, Fuck You, we&#39;ll do it ourselves). And magically, the tokens are gone.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve heard a lot of fuckery surrounding the tokenized stocks and shorts using them as another way to buy another day, but if our beloved stock only has 739 million outstanding shares available, how in the fuck were 1 billion tokens &quot;backed&quot; by actual shares introduced and removed from February to May 2023 without anyone noticing??</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mDH4PphvJ5Ul1Xow7o6VGWA5su8BJoDKU6IIFwgugEg.jpg\"/></div>"},
