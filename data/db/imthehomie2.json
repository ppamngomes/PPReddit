The tax implications of a realized loss like this will really mess with people&#39;s taxes next Spring if this saga isn&#39;t really over. I&#39;m not sure how we ever get our shares back if we pay 2023 taxes with this realized loss factored in. I&#39;ve heard of restructurings through Ch. 11 bankruptcies that lasted a couple years, but in most cases it sounds like shares were never removed from brokerage accounts like we&#39;ve had happen here.</p>\n\n<p>I want to start talking about this now because I haven&#39;t seen this concern brought up. Looking for any info/reassurance if the conversation is already happening and I missed it. Thanks guys</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
