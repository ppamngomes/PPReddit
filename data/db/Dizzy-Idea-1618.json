This form is required by Rule 12d2-2 (17 CFR 240.12d2-2) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities ExchaAngcet of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d).\n2. Exchanges: Attach the delisting determination to this Form 25 to serve as the required Notice pursuant to Exchange Act Rul1e9d-1 (17 CFR 240.19d-1). Form 25 and the attached Notice will be considered compliance with the provisions of Rule 19d-1 as applilcea. b\n3. The Form 25 and any attachments must be filed electronically on the EDGAR database.\n4. The removal of the class of securities from listing on the exchange shall be effective 10 days after filing the Form 25. Whitrespect to the filing of any amendment to Form 25, the removal of the class of securities from listing on the exchange shall be effective days after filing the amended Form 25.\n5. The withdrawal of registration of a class of securities registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act shall take effecitn 90 days, or such shorter period as the Commission may determine, after the exchange or issuer files a Form 25 with the Commission. With respect to the filing of any amendment to Form 25, the withdrawal of registration of a class of securities registered under Seticon 12(b) shall take effect in 90 days, or such shorter period as the Commission may determine, after the exchange or issuer files the amended Form 25.\n6. For purposes of Section 12 of the Exchange Act, a class of securities shall no longer be considered listed on a national securities exchange upon the effective date of delisting even though the withdrawal of registration is effective at a later time.\n7. The issuer\u2019s duty to file any reports under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder as aresult of the security\u2019s registration under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act shall be suspended upon the effective date of the delisting. If, following the effective date of delisting, the withdrawal of registration under Section 12(b) is delayed by the Commission, aenxchange, or an issuer, the issuer shall, within 60 days of such delay, file any reports that would have been required under Section 13(a) and the rules and regulations thereunder, had the Form 25 not been filed.

An issuer whose reporting responsibilities under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act are suspended for a class of securities under Rule 12d2-2(d)(5) is, nevertheless, required to file any reports that an issuer with such a class of securities registered\nunder Section 12 of the Exchange Act would be required to file under Section 13(a) if such class of securities:\n(a) is registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act; or\n(b) would be registered, or would be required to be registered, under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act but for the exemption from registration under Section 12(g) provided by Section 12(g)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.\n9. An issuer whose reporting responsibilities under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act are suspended under Rule 12d2-2(d)(5) is, nevertheless, required to file any reports that would be required under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act but for the fact thatthe reporting obligations are: (a) suspended for a class of securities under Rule 12d2-2(d)(5); and (b) suspended, terminated, or otherwise absent under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The reporting responsibilities of an issuer under Section 15(d) of the ExchangeAct shall continue until the issuer is required to file reports under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act or the issuer\u2019s reportingersponsibili- ties under Section 15(d) are otherwise suspended.\n10.
