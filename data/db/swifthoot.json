Also highlighted in one of the twitter spaces, with Salvatore&#39;s aversion to accept they could well be involved.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly although he stepped down as CEO, the largest owner of Apollo is still Leon Black at 15% as per sec filing Jan 23. Is he (in the financial world) a good egg or a rotten one? Well a snippet from the below article gives us some indication...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/apollo-founder-absolutely-regrets-taking-firm-public\">https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/apollo-founder-absolutely-regrets-taking-firm-public</a></p>\n\n<p>&quot;He described consulting a dozen investors he respected when deciding whether to go public, including Michael Milken, Carl Icahn, Marty Lipton and Lloyd Blankfein.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So we can take some relief that a majority shareholder in Apollo, respects and has previously taken advice from Papa Ichan \ud83d\udc4c</p>\n\n<p>So, that out of the way, who has Apollo acquired in the past and by what method? Below is a link showing some recent acquisitions...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pestakeholder.org/news/following-recent-acquisitions-private-equity-firm-apollo-ranks-among-largest-us-employers/\">https://pestakeholder.org/news/following-recent-acquisitions-private-equity-firm-apollo-ranks-among-largest-us-employers/</a></p>\n\n<p>Wowzers in 2021 they acquired none other than Hertz \ud83d\udc40</p>\n\n<p>So how did that come to be? Well the below link gives some detail...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hertz-selects-6-billion-bid-from-knighthead-certares-and-apollo-to-fund-chapter-11-exit-301290040.html\">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hertz-selects-6-billion-bid-from-knighthead-certares-and-apollo-to-fund-chapter-11-exit-301290040.html</a></p>\n\n<p>The juicy bit with in the above link, as quoted..</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hertz has selected and approved a revised proposal from certain funds and accounts managed by affiliates of each of Knighthead Capital Management LLC (&quot;Knighthead&quot;), Certares Opportunities LLC (&quot;Certares&quot;) and Apollo Capital Management,&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Ssoooooooooo, I am not sure why up to now, we have had a fair few bed wetters at the thought that they MIGHT be involved \ud83e\udd37</p>\n\n<p>Back to Michael&#39;s stores and on the note of focusing on growing online presence, leaning away from bricks and mortar, the following link dated Feb 28th is somewhat juicy...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thecurrent.media/michaels-third-party-marketplace\">https://thecurrent.media/michaels-third-party-marketplace</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is the juicy bit from the above article...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Michaels is growing its online assortment from 250,000 SKUs to more than one million. The third-party marketplace is playing a big role in that effort.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Instead of a subscription or listing fees, Michaels is opting for curation of sellers. They receive a standard commission.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Sounds to me like a future challenger to Amazon in the making \ud83e\udd37</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I am not saying I believe that, over RC, the above is what will happen for us instead. I&#39;m still convinced he is involved and will rear his beautiful head above the parapet any day now. I purely and simply wanted to alleviate the concerns I have come across with regard to Apollo&#39;s and Michael&#39;s involvement.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above, it would certainly be spicy as fuck if in some way RC and Apollo have come together on this play. </p>\n\n<p>Although Apollo made Michael&#39;s stores private  they did so to &quot;have financial flexibility to invest in, expand and improve their retail and digital platforms&quot;. As highlighted in the above link, they have achieved this.</p>\n\n<p>MAYBE, now that they have achieved said, they are ready to absorb BBBY and go public with the newly conjoined entity, taking advantage of the NOL&#39;s. Again, as highlighted above, Apollo a once private company went public themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Throw all that we know about RC into the mix and we&#39;ve got some spicy as hopium going into next week \ud83d\udc4c</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that is more than enough bullshit DD from such a smooth ape as myself.
