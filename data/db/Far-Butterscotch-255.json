Perfectly planned and propitiously timed - more Jewish tinfoil to get your tits jacked for the coming week", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Not: Financial advice; religious rant; divisive rhetoric </p>\n\n<p>As I\u2019d predicted all along on the PP Show, the good guys on this play are all observant Jews who \u201cbelieve\u201d in doing the right(eous) things. Once again, our heroes behind this unprecedented \u201cmother of all shorts slaughtered\u201d are the venerable RC/CI/HBC/DOM (and potentially a sleuth of other supporting characters). I\u2019d called into the Show just prior to Rosh Hashanah and predicted that the plan will begin to be revealed after Yom Kippur. This is a most auspicious time on the Jewish calendar. Refer to my previous post on the significance of YK:</p>\n\n<p>Sure enough, we\u2019ve all witnessed what transpired on Friday at the close of the market. I cannot emphasize enough just how carefully and meticulously precise the timing of the events on this play, which must have been thought-out painstakingly months (if not years) prior to its implementation.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I\u2019ve been able to track, every significant event thus far has occurred on or coincided with a Jewish event of significance on the Hebrew calendar. For example, let\u2019s examine this past Friday. Aside from being the final trading day for the ticker symbol BBBYQ,  Friday 29 of September is known as Erev Sukkot September 29\u2014Tishrei 14 \u201cThe Day Before Sukkot\u201d where \u201cit is traditional to give extra charity, for true joy is sharing with others,\u201d for which we were all given the gift of \u201chope and renewal\u201d which characterized Sukkot with a series of juicy docket drops just before the beginning of the holiday of Sukkot at sundown. </p>\n\n<p>Why this coming week is the MOST JOYFUL week of all \u2014 as our heroes have planned it all along, Sunday night at sundown marks the beginning of the \u201cintermediate days\u201d of Sukkot. Said intermediate days are quasi holidays, known as Chol Hamoed where Jews are \u201cgiven a free pass\u201d by the Torah to conduct business and mundane activities. </p>\n\n<p>My dear fellow regards, I propose to you as Heaven and Earth as my witness that the upcoming week of intermediate days of Sukkot known as Chol Hamoed (nightfall on October 2 until sundown on October 6 in 2023) as the most monumental days the modern global financial system has ever witnessed. It shall be a period of unprecedented prosperity for those of us who are still here hodling with unwavering conviction in spite of countless hate and vitriolic attempts by those who doubted us. It shall be a period of staggering defeat of financial terrorism and its numerous cohorts at historic proportions. It shall be a period where our collective hopes, dreams and aspirations will finally be answered, and our convictions vigorously vindicated. </p>\n\n<p>I have stated all along that this was more than a money play for the heroes behind it. It is deeply spiritual, esoteric, and altruistic in nature. As such, it will meet the approval from Above. </p>\n\n<p>Semper Fi \ud83e\udd8b</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
