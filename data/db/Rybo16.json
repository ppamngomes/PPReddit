Been listening to Sal&#39;s calls since the 29th September and he mentions sometimes that diversifing and attacking shorts through their leverage on other short positions is important or possible... I&#39;m wondering if anyone could shed light as to what stocks are linked , I think from what I&#39;ve picked up maybe kroll or partycity, not wanting to shill or be shilled just hoping for some light on the subject. Thanks for everything my dudes and dudettes</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#94e044"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
