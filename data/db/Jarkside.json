But last nights docket dump makes it clear that over 250 leases are being either rejected or terminated. So if the leases are gone, that means there are no stores, and there are no employees. Which begs the question, what\u2019s left?</p>\n\n<p>If you say the NOLs, and that\u2019s the only asset remaining, even those tax benefits are only worth pennies on the dollar. For instance, if you have one dollar worth of NOL and buyers want to buy that at a discount, they might pay 25 cents for that tax benefit. All that is without considering outstanding debt.</p>\n\n<p>So if the leases are rejected or terminated, the employees are all fired, the IP has been sold, what\u2019s left? What is the bull case here?</p>\n\n<p>Again, not trying to shill but last nights dockets have completely changed the game in my mind. What am I missing?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I went through the following dockets -</p>\n\n<p>898,1127,1356,1302,1537,1538,1539,705,731,1157,1114, and 1428.</p>\n\n<p>If you add up the Rejected Leases, there are 329 rejected leases. These leases are gone as of next week.</p>\n\n<p>If you add up the sold leases, I get 209. </p>\n\n<p>Some leases showed up in both lists. I counted 67 duplicates.</p>\n\n<p>By adding the sold leases to the rejected leases and subtracting the duplicates, I am getting 471 leases.</p>\n\n<p>I am probably missing a few from this list\u2026 but the argument stands\u2026 the 300 lease argument is debunked. There are few - if any - leases remaining in BBBYQ\u2019s control.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
