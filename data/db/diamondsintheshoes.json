Exciting enough to feel compelled to look through the docket(s) that are potentially driving the excitement. I just wanted to share my approach to docket 2294 and maybe some people can read it and fill in some gaps I have in my understanding and maybe just maybe it&#39;ll do something positive for someone somewhere. I never do write ups like this, I feel like I don&#39;t have enough to contribute but today feels important. I don&#39;t really know much about anything, so uh, keep that in mind. I wouldn&#39;t pay me to give financial advice nor would anyone else pay me for financial advice either so far. This is mostly just notes I took while going through the docket. 2294 is pretty short and when you step back and put it in logical boxes it becomes simple yet hugely indicative to the most important aspects of any process, not just this bankruptcy process, and that is; the ACTIONS taken by PEOPLE for MOTIVES. In this case, the actions are the PROJECTS, (i.e. Valuations, Employee Matters, Financial / Operational Matters.) the people are the LAWYERS, and the motives are the PRESERVATION OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS. </p>\n\n<p>To Begin, here is the fee summary by LAWYER:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u2ccg20mdvqb1.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ad8abc2feda90758fd4fd24c13c08fbc6fb374b\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/u2ccg20mdvqb1.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ad8abc2feda90758fd4fd24c13c08fbc6fb374b\" alt=\" Note: significant drop off of hours worked after the top 3. Everyone&#39;s hourly fee varies by as little as plus or minus $25 dollars. It seems oddly specific, numerology perhaps?\"></a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Top 4 highest paid lawyers:\n\n<ul>\n<li>1. Sinclair, Gibbons 177.3 hrs @ $675 =  $119,677.50 </li>\n<li>2. Brouwer, Matthew 117 hrs @ $900 = $105,300</li>\n<li>3. Sterling, Andrew 113.9 hrs @ $600 = $68,340</li>\n<li>4. Greenberg, Mark 51.5 hrs @ $1,200 = $61,800<br/></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also in the fee statement that could be interesting to those with more experience:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8j9u4trjevqb1.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb70ad8e6b0fd04e897bb65472c1532f54f0578c\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/8j9u4trjevqb1.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb70ad8e6b0fd04e897bb65472c1532f54f0578c\" alt=\"Already exceeding maximum allowed collected fee but banking holdback ? What is holdback ? 2,360,323 - 1,888,258.40 does in fact equal 472,064.60\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Next, these afore-listed LAWYERS spent their time on these PROJECTS:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1hd2k6o4fvqb1.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c006c7154baf137d07a3141eafcbade8d799df12\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/1hd2k6o4fvqb1.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c006c7154baf137d07a3141eafcbade8d799df12\" alt=\" \"></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Top 4 projects by time consumption:\n\n<ul>\n<li>1. Valuation: 206.7 hrs</li>\n<li>2. Financial &amp; Operational Matters: 182.8 hrs</li>\n<li>3. Employee Matters: 165.7 hrs </li>\n<li>4. Potential Avoidance Actions / Litigation Matters: 76.4 hrs</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obviously valuation being at the top is huge. Something something Holly Etlin testified 5 billion dollar valuation in court. Honestly all of these are huge when considering the bull thesis. Why spend 165 hours on \u201cEmployee Matters\u201d for people that aren\u2019t going to have jobs because all the stores are closing down right ????</p>\n\n<p>It is also super important to conceptualize that all these ACTIONS have to be itemized and dutifully recorded because all of it is under high scrutiny in an active bankruptcy court setting, especially one of this high public profile. All money spent on LAWYERS has to be defendably spent in the INTEREST OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS (3.a. on page 13 says this less more formally) </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ivg12cttfvqb1.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58ea474433bb62afaecdcd7f688fa681749bf4d3\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/ivg12cttfvqb1.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58ea474433bb62afaecdcd7f688fa681749bf4d3\" alt=\"3.a. Page 13 Docket 2294\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This concept should also be applied to the past fee statements, including all the hours spent on exploring mergers &amp; acquisitions. </p>\n\n<p>The docket ends with an itemized breakdown of each individual ACTION take by the LAWYERS. 24 pages long.  I tried converting the pdf to an excel so I could sort alphabetically to better figure out what each individual lawyer focused on but the free software I am using to do it keeps throwing errors at me. It&#39;s honestly not that much data so it isn&#39;t too important but maybe someone with the premium adobe stuff can pick up where I left off. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tkqsimijgvqb1.png?width=872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87b72bc106e9a92523c826fff87cfce714872168\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/tkqsimijgvqb1.png?width=872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87b72bc106e9a92523c826fff87cfce714872168\" alt=\"Lots of talk about long-term and incentives / compensation for executives here.

Also, like I previously mentioned, Matthew Brouwer and Sinclair Gibbons show up a lot so perhaps it would be wise to take a gander at their track record. Okay Google, tell me the things I need to know. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alvarezandmarsal.com/our-people/matthew-brouwer\">https://www.alvarezandmarsal.com/our-people/matthew-brouwer</a></p>\n\n<p>\u201cMatt Brouwer is a Senior Director with Alvarez &amp; Marsal\u2019s North American Commercial Restructuring practice in Nashville. He brings more than twelve years of accounting and financial experience advising clients in Canada and the U.S.\u201d Keyword: restructuring. He also has a LinkedIn page but I do not have a page myself and cannot view it. Perhaps someone  more professional than me can find something on his page. </p>\n\n<p>Gibbons Sinclair is a little harder to find info on. This individual has been an associate at Alvarez &amp; Marsal since May 2020 and is also an assistant director at Charter Oak Financial Consultants LLC and has been there since 2008. He also has a LinkedIn page for the interested. My brain is smooth and my eyes are glazed over. This is all I am good for. Maybe someone else can tap in.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/at4PxwRZYnTPpU0qyRuxYFYEPVTP2KZ_JdqCRq7ofPY.jpg\"/></div>"},
