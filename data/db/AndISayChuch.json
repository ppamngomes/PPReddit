Thanks in advance!\n\n-More debt reduced\n-They mentioned the NOLs (preserved)\n-They did say shareholders would get extinguished\n-a LOT more extensions which means the stock won\u2019t go to 0 for a while IF this really is the final plan, meaning someone could still theoretically step in and acquire and for that reason I\u2019m still holding, and proudly regarded.", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

They said it would be at 0 on Friday.\n\nThey tune into The PP Show and watch the whole thing, praying they\u2019ll get a good clip they can post on their pathetic sub for 40 upvotes.\n\nWe\u2019ve got SS mods paying money for filings just to prove that \u201cno, teddys not a bank, I\u2019m angry that a PP show guest speculated that that was the case.\u201d They can\u2019t stand the thought of any other stock than the single one they own getting any attention.\n\nI really don\u2019t understand why they hate the play so much, I feel bad for them. But Holly Etlin and co are about to blow them out of the water pretty soon. It\u2019s a profitable company with dramatically reduced debt. Icahn and RC go to the same synagogue, haters can suck an egg. \n\nAnyway I\u2019m just rambling. I like the stock. I\u2019m buying more today. NFA. Have a great day everyone!", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
