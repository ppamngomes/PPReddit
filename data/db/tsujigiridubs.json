According to Jewish tradition, on Rosh Hashanah, God inscribes each person&#39;s fate for the coming year into the Book of Life, and waits until Yom Kippur to &quot;seal&quot; the verdict. This process is described dramatically in the poem Unetanneh Tokef, which is recited on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur: </p>\n\n<p>A great shofar will be blown, and a small still voice will be heard. The angels will make haste, and be seized with fear and trembling, and will say: &quot;Behold, the day of judgment!&quot;... On Rosh Hashanah it is written, and on the Yom Kippur fast it is sealed, how many will pass and how many will be created, who will live and who will die, who in his time and who not in his time... But repentance, prayer, and charity remove the evil of the decree... For You do not desire a person&#39;s death, but rather that he repent and live. Until the day of his death You wait for him; if he repents, You accept him immediately. </p>\n\n<h3>Jewish unity</h3>\n\n<p>Yom Kippur is considered a day of Jewish unity. In Kol Nidre, in which vows are released, vows of excommunication against sinning Jews were similarly lifted and these &quot;transgressors&quot; were allowed to pray alongside other Jews. According to the Talmud, &quot;Any fast in which Jewish sinners do not also participate is not a valid fast&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Mishnah describes Yom Kippur as a day on which men and women would once meet each other in the vineyards in order to arrange marriages.  - <strong>Merger/Acquisition?!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h2>Date of Yom Kippur</h2>\n\n<p>Yom Kippur falls each year on the tenth day of the Jewish month of Tishrei, which is nine days after the first day of Rosh Hashanah. In terms of the Gregorian calendar, the earliest date on which Yom Kippur can fall is September 14, as happened most recently in 1899 and 2013. The latest Yom Kippur can occur relative to the Gregorian dates is on October 14, as happened in 1967 and will happen again in 2043. After 2089, the differences between the Hebrew calendar and the Gregorian calendar will result in Yom Kippur falling no earlier than September 15. Gregorian calendar dates for recent and upcoming Yom Kippur holidays are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sunset, 15 September 2021 \u2013 nightfall, 16 September 2021</li>\n<li>Sunset, 4 October 2022 \u2013 nightfall, 5 October 2022</li>\n<li>Sunset, 24 September 2023 \u2013 nightfall, 25 September 2023</li>\n<li>Sunset, 11 October 2024 \u2013 nightfall, 12 October 2024</li>\n<li>Sunset, 1 October 2025 \u2013 nightfall, 2 October 2025</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Stay Regarded My Friends.
