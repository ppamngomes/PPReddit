Underwriters in the U.S. typically charge 5% to 7% of proceeds. Underpricing of shares takes another 10% to 15%, on average; total costs of $100 million aren\u2019t unusual for large deals. It\u2019s not surprising that many owners pursue other options, especially M&amp;A.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Bankrupt, saddled with over a billion in Net Operating Losses (NOLs), many might think it&#39;s a lost cause. But here&#39;s where it gets interesting.</p>\n\n<p>We all know IPOs are a money sink. Between underwriter fees and share underpricing, they can burn through cash faster than a fat kid in a candy store. But, there&#39;s this lesser-known strategy, the <strong>&quot;Tax Receivable Agreement&quot; (TRA)</strong>, that can ease the pain.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the TL;DR on TRAs: They help increase a company&#39;s tax basis post-IPO without adding extra tax costs for the seller. This trick means less income tax on post-IPO profits. And the kicker? The seller gets a large chunk of these future tax savings, usually spread over 15 years. Sweet deal, right?</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine this strategy applied to BBBYQ. An acquiring company (cough: TEDDY) could not only make use of those billion-dollar NOLs (a nice perk, btw) but also leverage a TRA to score considerable future tax savings, thereby making the acquisition a potentially profitable move.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/11/a-cheaper-way-to-do-ipos\">A Cheaper Way to Do IPOs (hbr.org)</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
