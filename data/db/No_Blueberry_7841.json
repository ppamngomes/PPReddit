If you search the docket for &quot;P. Wu&quot; you will find her name referenced 36 times and most of these are surrounded by discussions with potential bidders, <strong>Sixth Street going concern plan</strong>, etc.   While all this was pre auction, there was still a lot of time spent discussing <strong>BABY standalone plans</strong> and <strong>BABY going concern plans</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I then moved over to Docket 2155 (AP services compensation report for July) and Docket 2094 (Lazard compensation report for July) and saw some interesting discussions taking place after the IP auction and even after the Going Concern auction was cancelled.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Docket 2155 (AP Services):</p>\n\n<p>7/4/23 - Lazard, DOM, and Patty Wu discussed BABY going concern models (pre going concern auction so they possibly just couldn&#39;t strike a deal)</p>\n\n<p>7/11/23 - Lazard, DOM, and Patty Wu discussed a &quot;<strong>go-forward corporate organization and strategy</strong>&quot; (this could be for DOM remaining private with no intention of going public)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>There is also discussion about &quot;50 and 75 door scenarios&quot; and also &quot;50 and 75 store recommendations&quot;.  <strong>Can anyone clarify what this might be referring to?</strong> (page 22 of docket 2155)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Docket 2094 (Lazard):</p>\n\n<p>&quot;going concern&quot; is found 5 times in the docket.  There was a call on 7/6/23 with the Going Concern Buyers (it was only half an hour so this could have been the call where no bids were made on a going concern option which led to them cancelling the auction).</p>\n\n<p>It was mention again on 7/10/23 where 2 members of Lazard participated in a call titled &quot;Transition Call with Going Concern buyers&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If there was no Going Concern buyer and the 7/7/23 auction was cancelled then who is the transition call with and what are they transitioning?</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Based on my experience and discussions with counsel, it is my belief that the  exculpation provision described in Article X.E. of the Plan (the \u201cExculpation\u201d) is appropriate  under applicable law because it was proposed in good faith, was formulated following extensive  good-faith, arm\u2019s-length discussions with key constituents, and is appropriate limited in scope.  The Exculpated Parties played a critical role in negotiating, formulating, and implementing the  Disclosure Statement, the Plan, and related documents. <strong>I understand that the inclusion of the  Exculpation provision was a critical component of the negotiations over the terms of the Plan. In  short, I believe the Exculpation represents an integral piece of the overall settlement embodied in  the Plan.</strong> Accordingly, under the circumstances, I believe that it is appropriate for the Court to  approve the Exculpation provision.  &quot;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I figured it was worth discussing what makes theses so critical however if this has already been discussed previously then mods please lock this thread.
