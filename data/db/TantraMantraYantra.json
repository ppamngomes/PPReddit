This is less plausible to me because RC involvement started March last year and this facility funding and planning cannot happen that quick (I could be wrong regarding how fast things move, but getting that huge facility up and running cannot be under a year under normal circumstances)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If the first possibility is true, did the power/s behind it engineer bbby bankruptcy trapping investors?
