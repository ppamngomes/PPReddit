With that said my biggest question here is why are people who are against this play or for this play even arguing over a ticker that can not only be bought but also can\u2019t be sold present moment? Why are alleged shills trying to say one side is wrong or vise versa when there isn\u2019t anything that can be done anymore but wait and see what comes to fruition? It seems weird to go back and forth? If you bought and held till the end then we will see what happens right? As far as I can see it\u2019s a zero or hero situation that can\u2019t be stopped from here on out? Anyone else feel the same way?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
