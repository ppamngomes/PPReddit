I wasn&#39;t concerned because I figured the shares would all consolidate into Schwab at some point in the future. Now that our shares have deemed &quot;worthless&quot;, does anybody if the BBBYQ shares will be transferred along with the other tickers and money in the account?\nMy transition from TD to Schwab starts in 10 days. Because they &quot;hold no value&quot;, does that mean they will not be transferred. This feels like such a specifically unique situation. I just want to keep my shares.\nThank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
