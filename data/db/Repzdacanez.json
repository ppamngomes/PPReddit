I&#39;m not. Why? Because the other ticker is WHY I tossed as much money into BBBYQ as I could at 0.05 and other people were screaming &quot;its over!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Now to dig into my non financial advice dd- xxxq (we&#39;ll say) declared Ch 11 bankruptcy. Had tremendous revenue. But was hampered by a slow down in revenue and crippling debt (you might be able to compare covid hampering bbbyq). Bankruptcy sent it down to the bottom. And then another 50% down so it hit a low of 0.04. I saw the value in it and a ch11 restructuring. What I liked most was specific language for &quot;meaningful recoveries for unsecured shareholders.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That language doesn&#39;t exist for bbbyq though, so why would I add at 0.05? I&#39;ll tell you why! This is a cult. There are 69k members in the bbby community. 15k in the pp community. We like the stock. We like that cohen likes the stock. I downloaded the app, and bought a bunch of stuff for my house, great experience! But too little too late. The company has too much debt and needs to restructure. That is what ch 11 does. Its the &quot;better of the bankruptcies&quot;. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Would bbby ruin its reputation and shareholder base wiping out retail investors? My opinion is no.</li>\n<li>Would overstock buy the IP of a company intent on wiping out retail investors? My opinion is no.</li>\n<li>Is it undervalued? Sue Grove says its worth in the billions. Even if shareholders get anything (rare) it might be 3-5% of the newly issued equity. So there is a floor somewhere in there between 0-5% of what the new company is worth. EVEN if you disregard all the rumors about a great buyout etc. \n4,5,6. All the other DD.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t chart. I don&#39;t do technicals. I just know when I bought xxxq it did a triple top and then broke a 200ma and went flying. Funny how similar the charts look.</p>\n\n<p>I think that ucopy was right but the price was manipulated with CRIME. Therefore his banbet should be nullified.</p>\n\n<p>I will place my own banbet to save myself and ucopy. If bbbyq breaks 0.40 and rips faces off, his ban is nullified. If we get nothing from Bankruptcy, or if we break 0.40 and get shut down again you can ban us both. No time limit. You can&#39;t time or chart crime and market manipulation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/oqmxdxrcc0cb1.jpg\"/></div>"},

I saw the value in corzq in the mining and they had specific language in the bankruptcy filings for unsecured shareholders.\n\nThat is something I still havnt found in anything for bbbyq. So ultra risky everyone might get wiped out.. however, bbby has become somewhat of a memestock and cult following. They are risking everything by wiping out the current shareholders that held this from the meme stock rally all the way down to 0.05. Would overstock purchase the ip and brand name for millions if bbbyq literally gives shareholders nothing? I feel like everyone would be pretty salty. I was more than happy to shop there to try and help the numbers but would never shop there again if this doesn't turn out right. 62k members in the bbby reddit group, thousands in the ppshow.\n\nI'm not a chart guy, (the market is nothing but fraud) but the double or triple top in corzq looks similar to the bbbyq chart. The difference is also only 0.10 and they almost hit the lows to the penny. If bbbyq can break 0.40 it could get fun, but everything here is really riding on the bankruptcy. If it were going to 0, why not let it go to 5 or 10$? Shorts might never have to close. (Tinfoil is shorts were planning on newly issued securities to be issued in corzq but bitty doubled and the bankruptcy still has a couple of months, that Marge calling???) If the tinfoil is right and there is some plan for icahn or whatever then shorts might not need to close still but they would probably still want the equity if any is given to bbbyq shareholders?\n\nCorzq has been my best play ever. And I hope that u barbequers have something here. Again just ranting. Nfa. This is all just pure speculation and the lack of language for unsecured shareholders means everyone holding shares could be very very very wrong.", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/P4stoCwugSI7lO7PA_UPErIGxfRrwEeW-ZjcjRCcr2s.jpg\"/></div>"},
