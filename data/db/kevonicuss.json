I have yet to see anyone with removed shares show their shares back in their brokerage account. </p>\n\n<p>I saw a post titled &quot; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17knsxz/you_cannot_uncancel_cancelled_shares/\">You cannot uncancel cancelled shares?</a> &quot; and that the statement came from one of the lawyers during today&#39;s hearing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOWEVER that appears to be false!!!</strong> <em>DISCLAIMER - I am not a lawyer. I can read, kind of.</em> </p>\n\n<p>Bankruptcy Code 1127, specifically section (b). You can read the code here: <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1127\">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1127</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Section (b) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The proponent of a plan or the reorganized debtor may modify such plan at any time after confirmation of such plan and before <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=11-USC-1318967965-70892687&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=\">substantial consummation</a> of such plan, but may not modify such plan so that such plan as modified fails to meet the requirements of sections <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1122\">1122</a> and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1123\">1123</a> of this title. Such plan as modified under this subsection becomes the plan only if circumstances warrant such modification and the court, after notice and a hearing, confirms such plan as modified, under <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1129\">section 1129 of this title</a>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>What does this mean? In simple terms, a debtor (or other party in interest) may request modification of a confirmed plan. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, A priority claim arising from an Administrative Expense Priority (Admin Priority) may have the right to request modification to a confirmed plan under certain circumstances. Hmmmm, where have we seen an Admin Priority before? Oh yeah, a $10 BILLION dollar claim!</p>\n\n<p>So, regarding the cancellation and issuance of shares, it technically is possible under bankruptcy code 1127 if they do try to amend the confirmed plan. Of course, all of it is subject to legal process/court approval. But if the debtor (company) wants to un-cancel previously cancelled shares, it would need to propose this as part of the modification process under bankruptcy code 1127 (b), which can be done by the parties listed above. </p>\n\n<p>I will reiterate,  I am not a lawyer, and this information is not legal advice nor is any of this information financial advice. </p>\n\n<p>But the ticker appearing again makes me jacked.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Bankruptcy code 1127", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is straight tinfoil and even a bit a hopium on my part (since my shares in Fidelity say &quot;expired position&quot; and the few I had in Robinhood were just straight up removed). BUT it&#39;s just crazy enough to work and make sense.</p>\n\n<h1>Part 1: The Tweet</h1>\n\n<p>Starting with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phantomblack699/status/1714662514984669679?s=46\">Sal&#39;s Tweet</a>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;Overstock started using the IP rights within 14 hours of the auction. Why haven\u2019t Dream on me started using such a valuable asset to them?&quot;</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What an excellent question. BABY was the crown jewel and was the money maker for BBBY the last couple of years in terms of being profitable. It was a focal point of RC in his <a href=\"https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf\">initial letter to the board</a>. So that really does beg the question WHY would you not get a $1.5 billion dollar brand up and running (online first) as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I&#39;m in the ecommerce space and I see websites get built all the time. There are ranging complexities that go into build and I know it&#39;s not as easy as Overstock just rebranding, switching it&#39;s domain and ensuring all the re-directs are in place... <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, I have seen some sites of medium complexity (a handful of key integrations) launch within 90-day. If inventory existed, which I believe it did as there was a video a few months back after DOM won the bid of a fully stocked warehouse, why would this iconic brand not be up and taking orders via the web already. </li>\n<li>We also know the landing page is a Shopify landing page so once a catalog is loaded, they can start transacting fairly quick</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Part 2: The comment</h1>\n\n<p>Now the fun part and I will directly quote a comment from <a href=\"/u/PotentialMotion\">/u/PotentialMotion</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;My thought is that by spinning out the IP, DOM focused on building while BBBY focused on winding down. This way both could happen in parallel (legally, without revealing anything in bankruptcy docs) only to combine at a later date.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is interesting. Didn&#39;t DOM all of the sudden have some previous BBBY employees who were on the digital team? They did. In fact, BABY&#39;s new VP of Digital Technology (as of August 2023) was at BBBY the 5-years before that doing virtually the same thing. Who better to build and oversee a highly scalable site, that knows the BABY consumer, and can launch from scratch as quickly as possible. </p>\n\n<p>So was DOM involved so that legally they can build and have BuyBuyBaby ready to launch once this thing is fully settled and without disclosing to much via dockets?</p>\n\n<h1>Part 3: The new shares</h1>\n\n<p>Shares are cancelled. We know this from the 8-K. Today, we&#39;ve seen brokers starting to reflect changes by either removing shares from accounts or calling them expired. But I read through bankruptcy law (<strong><em>I am not a lawyer, just a smooth brained APE</em></strong>) specifically for amending a plan <strong>AFTER</strong> it&#39;s been approved. Guess what, it can happen. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>11 U.S. Code \u00a7 1127 - Modification of plan, specifically section B. <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1127\">Sauce</a>\n\n<ul>\n<li>(b)The proponent of a plan or the reorganized debtor may modify such plan at any time after confirmation of such plan and before substantial consummation of such plan, but may not modify such plan so that such plan as modified fails to meet the requirements of sections 1122 and 1123 of this title. Such plan as modified under this subsection becomes the plan only if circumstances warrant such modification and the court, after notice and a hearing, confirms such plan as modified, under section 1129 of this title.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Basically, Section 1127 allows for amendments to a confirmed plan, including potentially providing recovery to shareholders, as long as substantial steps toward implementing the original plan have not yet been taken and the changes meet the legal requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Keep in mind that any proposed amendments would still need to go through the formal process, which includes notifying relevant parties and obtaining court approval after a hearing.</em></p>\n\n<p>Also, did you know it&#39;s extremely rare for a debtor (company) to change their name during bankruptcy? So how about this for black tar tinfoil. Sixth Street now owns a bulk of the debt (RC is heavily involved) hence the first name change.  Since Sixth Street holds a significant portion of the debt, they can potentially be in a position to propose amendments to a confirmed plan under Section 1127 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This is because they would have a substantial stake in the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>Sixth Street amends the plan to issue new shares of the newly named company to existing holders of BBBY. 20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc. (TEDDY, GMERICA, Insert whatever you want) emerges from Bankruptcy and is ready to fly. They then announce the acquisition of BBBY Acquisition Co, LLC. who appears to be connected to DOM and is running the BABY website. The site is ready to launch and is now a debt free, publicly traded company selling BABY products. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Extra tinfoil</em></strong>. This newly formed public company operating BABY acquires the ultimate destination for video games in an all stock transaction.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I did some digging on other companies who went bankrupt, but exited with shareholders being made whole and found something interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Role the clocks back 10 years, American Airlines filed for bankruptcy. However, they had a NOL poison pill that was upheld ultimately protecting corporate assets and preventing institutions (or a group) from buying more than 5% of the company. This was put in place as protection against Qatar Airways. You can read about it <a href=\"https://www.theconglomerate.org/2017/06/index.html\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing I found interesting in this article was that the merger between the two companies was a section 382 &quot;change of ownership&quot; which added additional restrictions to the NOLs. Where have we seen that before? Oh yeah, the latest 10-K (<a href=\"https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/17306/html\">Page 15 of the 10-K</a> references it)!</p>\n\n<p>By going through with the Change of Ownership, it allowed American Airlines to put restrictions on the NOL and shareholders who own over 4.75% of the stock. Do you remember the request for a list of all parties owning over 4.5% of BBBY? Starting to make more sense. </p>\n\n<p>Ok, but KEV what does this have to do with BBBY, Teddy and GME? Great question.</p>\n\n<p>After looking at the merger between U.S. Airways and American, I think it&#39;s safe to say we may be very right about Teddy being the one buying the assets and keeping the business (BABY) as a going concern. However, it will go through the 382 change of ownership so that they can have restrictions on shareholders with over 4.5% ownership. But all shareholders will get shares of the new ticker. My guess is TDDY. This in my opinion will cause a GME like sneeze, maybe higher though since we know how bad this has been shorted. </p>\n\n<p>Now the real fireworks. Once the new ticker is established and we are effectively out of chapter 11, TDDY will perform an all stock or a cash + stock merger acquiring GME causing the real MOASS because we all should know, all stock or cash + stock causes a share recall and anyone swimming naked is fucked. </p>\n\n<p>Good things take time, but this just seems to make to much sense. As many of said, we either got this very wrong, or we had this very very VERY right. </p>\n\n<p>See you on the moon.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
