So this got me thinking of the possible role of Pulte in this whole debacle, beside the fact they often furnish their homes with BBBY products and were once the #147 Fortune 500 company. What if when you buy a Pulte Home, it comes with a digital model of the home you can use in the Metaverse? I read about NFTs being useful in home ownership but I haven&#39;t delved into it. Idk just some thoughts.
