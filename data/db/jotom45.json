I honestly think that the shorts know that the deal is all cash as apposed to a stock deal. Why would they be digging such a hole for themselves? Are they that stupid that they don&#39;t realise the real value of the company? Is it because they already know that there&#39;s a cash deal and that they will not have to buy back all the naked shorts that were created? The price action really looks like an attempt shake out of retail. The less shares we have the more Wall Street has. Thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
