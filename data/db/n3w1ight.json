Additionally recently I started to stand up for my decisions as I realized that I really accomplished a lot in my life and have to say, I come from reallyyyyyy nothing and even today I am still nothing, because of these fucked up economy. You have to be an instagram / tiktok champion and beautiful or do porn to get wealthy these days. I work in a normal job to pay bills of greedy assholes that cannot stop consuming BULLSHIT, while I can effort a house in what? 30-40 yrs? Son of a bitch.
