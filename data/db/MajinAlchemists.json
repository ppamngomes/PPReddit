We are the dumb apes to them but look at the community, look at all the knowledge anyone who has stumbled there way here could gain from thousands of hours of DD, research and of course the TINFOIL! They want to break our spirits with physiological warfare. We are not suppose to make money like they do and they can&#39;t stand it. PP gives the voice back to Retail and they can&#39;t stand that. Even if some how we are all wrong on this investment yeah it will suck and it will hurt our pockets but we will recover and we will never back down! Nothing is a cohencidence and if it is at this point its the Matrix or at least the one they have put in front of  our eyes.

The speed of the case is insane.

But the speed of which they reemerged is crazy. Now let&#39;s apply these steps to Bobby and say we see a BIG dip in price. &quot;Not till almost zero&quot;. But if we reemerged or IPO/Relist as Teddy the price change could be the same as comparing it to DBDQQs title 11. Bobby has more to offer in restructuring than DBDQQ and if Bobby goes this route then we could see that relisting/IPO price of $76-$78(Nols maximized). It&#39;s far-fetched but not out of reach.  We just have to hold on for the ride. All just tinfoil and hopium.

To the extent these requirements are met this allows the NOLS to be used going forward without the 382 limitations. (Ryan Cohen bought his shares in March 3, 2022. This would be 13 months after that and Bobby entered Title 11 April 11th 2023, So 18 months after he sold his shares would be   September 3, 2023. now i know no one wants to hear that but he may have to wait this last  month out perhaps. (Sorry for not editing before posting). RC owned 5-10% stake in the company at this time.

IF  short positions are forced to close then this is especially good for the company as a whole transferring the max value of a truly undervalued and over shorted stock. Even if the Utilization of NOLS only transfers at a 50% or 80% as stated in 382 this would be huge news for the exit out of Title 11.Shorts are forced to close and we squeeze the hell out of them on top of the fair market value being applied. So the price could go far beyond the beyond. Then If Teddy IPOs from that then it is a fucking home run back to back. Hold through the Bobby squeeze and then IPO on the Moon as Teddy. Minimum IPO price of oh i would say 420.69. But thats just my thoughts and research. I might be deadass wrong but we shall see.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
