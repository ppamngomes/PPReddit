What do you see as more likely: For or Against shareholder interests? \n\nOn the flip side, in a bear trap, they would need to push the negative sentiment while wading the waters. \n\nSue Gove lied about the chp11 on E*trade interview. Transcript posted with her smiling face :)\n\nDavid Kastin paid in all shares. Posting celebratory photos on IG & wrapping up on LinkedIn. \n\nHolly Etlin mentioned pump & dump allegations against RC. Kinda seemed like she was speaking against him. \n\nWhat is the reality that they are bad actors? What is the chance that they are setting a bear trap? It\u2019s hard to gage with docket accusation, BOD actions so far, and all the tinfoil. \n\nThen again if they were bad actors\u2026 why not just go into Chp7. Also why release DRS account holders in official documents. \n\nI\u2019m regarded, please help.", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
