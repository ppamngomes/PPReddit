Simply follow the link and scroll down the page until you find the easily identifiable &#39;auto populate&#39; option and hit the &#39;email taskforce&#39; button.</p>\n\n<p>It will set you up to send a message to right to the inbox of the appropriate people.\nUnfortunately their auto populate script doesn&#39;t seem to be functioning correctly right now, cutting off half the message, and so strongly recommend copying the template (shown below) from the &#39;alternative option&#39; tab on the website, located directly above the email link.</p>\n\n<p>There they also provide the information needed to send your own personalised message, either through the site itself or from your own account, to the following address.</p>\n\n<h1><a href=\"mailto:digitisationtaskforce@hmtreasury.gov.uk\">digitisationtaskforce@hmtreasury.gov.uk</a></h1>\n\n<p>With the subject line</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Feedback on Taskforce recommendations&quot;</p>\n\n<p>They also ask that you copy them into the email chain using <a href=\"mailto:taskforce.feedback@computershare.com\">taskforce.feedback@computershare.com</a></p>\n\n<p>So they can see your support, although of course this final part is optional.</p>\n\n<p>Comments are open to all investors, not just those that live in the UK, as this will have implications for any who uses there markets. All you need is an email and the willingness to click a couple of links.</p>\n\n<p>As you can understand this is an issue of a lot of importance and as such much of the work has already been done for you.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a good post on the stonkUK sub which it isn&#39;t possible to link to written by User Bibic-jr you might like to check out for extra details.</p>\n\n<p>Additional thanks go out to the UK Ape who brought this to my attention (as they seemed to understand I&#39;m happy to be a loud mouth). While they asked to remain anonymous would encourage any other international household investors who are experiencing similar attempts to disenfranchise them by local powers that be to get in touch if they would like assistance in attempting to add more voices to their defence against certain dickheads. </p>\n\n<p>While help may be needed in translating do ask you to not hesitate. It is disgusting to think your government would try rob you of basic rights that people share the world over.</p>\n\n<p>Original template from <a href=\"https://www.shareholder-feedback.com/en/home/\">https://www.shareholder-feedback.com/en/home/</a> below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Sir Douglas, As an individual shareholder, I write about your taskforce\u2019s proposals for the digitisation of the UK shareholder framework.</p>\n\n<p>While digitisation is a good thing, a new approach where my shares would have to be transferred to a nominee will take away my direct ownership of shares and associated rights. </p>\n\n<p>This approach risks valued fundamental rights, including voting on company proposals, attending, and asking questions at shareholder meetings, taking part in corporate actions, communicating with the company, and receiving direct dividends. There is no guarantee that a nominee provider would offer me those services. </p>\n\n<p>If they did, there is likely to be a cost for me where none exist currently. Where costs are rising everywhere, this is unfair. Shareholders should choose if their own name appears on the company\u2019s share register or if a nominee holds our shares. </p>\n\n<p>This is a right in other countries including the US, Hong Kong, Canada, France and Australia. While getting rid of paper certificates is positive, your proposals must retain the option for investors to hold shares directly and without having to use a nominee.</p>\n\n<p>This would safeguard our rights, maintain shareholder engagement, and preserve existing high standards of corporate governance. </p>\n\n<p>I look forward to seeing the updated report and hope my concerns, and those of other shareholders, are reflected. </p>\n\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>LFG</p>\n\n<p>Apes together\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Final disclaimer: this a near, but not entirely, identical repost to something found in the other gamestop subs. Thank you for your time and continued efforts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
