I purchased 7 shares of Toys r Us on July 11th for .02 a share for a total of .16 . They told me that they go through Citi bank to get those shares and it then processed a $50.11 fee that I didn\u2019t have available in my account. it didn\u2019t show that there was a commission fee when making the purchase. Since I didn\u2019t have the cash in my account it kicked my account into margin when I don\u2019t have margin enabled onto my account??? I own close to 30,000 bbbyq shares in this account with now 7 toys r us shares. I initially set up this account 2 years ago with margin activated but have it not enabled for over a year now with the current situation going on with lending shares. I\u2019m telling you guys this because I was unaware that they had my account on margin for weeks now without it being enabled all due to a commission fee of $50.11 that I was unaware of when making the purchase of 7 toys r us shares for .16  which ended up costing me over $50. Seems suspect to me\u2026.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
