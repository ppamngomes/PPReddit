I wanted to add on to my last post regarding the numerology that surrounds this saga. I&#39;ll link it here for context. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/16y5yx4/1040_work_buckle_up_were_here/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/16y5yx4/1040_work_buckle_up_were_here/</a></p>\n\n<p>I mentioned in this post that the messaging is like a rubic&#39;s cube and takes moving things around between different accounts, date, times, etc. to find something that clicks. For example, 04/10 could also be 10/04 or 01/04 in regards to connecting things from diffrent people and switching numbers around to get a click. If it&#39;s difficult to understand, that&#39;s okay. Just keep an open mind. You could also think it&#39;s stupid or crazy, that&#39;s totally fine too haha none of this if finacial advice but I love numbers because they can&#39;t lie. </p>\n\n<p>One thing in particular I found interesting has been the messaging constantly throwing &quot;Christmas&quot; into the mix. Different accounts have mentioned Chirstmas out of nowhere and it has always made me and others perk up. </p>\n\n<p>So, I theorized that Christmas could&#39;ve been 9/25 because in military time 9/25 is 21:25 which is 12/25. Now, I&#39;m going to show how 9/25 could also be the upcoming 10/8 and how 9/27 could also be the date, 10/10.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ca4lrc0klesb1.png?width=1298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c414ee39e32f0afa0c052398570129fc20b820\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/ca4lrc0klesb1.png?width=1298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c414ee39e32f0afa0c052398570129fc20b820\" alt=\"2125 is 12/25\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Roaring kitty has a couple related Christmas related videos and Pulte started tweeted about Christmas right after I started looking into it. Roaring Kitty has one with a Shirt that says &quot;Game over&quot; and was posted on Christmas too. With a timestamp in the thumbnail of 2:32 which is mixed around to 3/22 the day Ryan tweeted &quot;I put my money where my mouth is&quot;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0yvqizbooesb1.png?width=1986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d25acf36ca0cdecf09daeb0e7a7c8e9d87eff46e\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/0yvqizbooesb1.png?width=1986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d25acf36ca0cdecf09daeb0e7a7c8e9d87eff46e\" alt=\"Christmas numbers like 21:25 (12/25) and Christmas Posts between Pulte and DFV\"></a></p>\n\n<p>You can see why I would get excited at the possibility of 9/25 bringing something something significant. Obviously, that wasn&#39;t the case. But then I started to think about the Rubic&#39;s cube and another way to spin it. What if the conversion from Gregorian to Julian Calander was another part of it the puzzle? This is where perhaps 9/25 is also 10/8. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rwuqu76xsesb1.png?width=1354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=154821bb0fd7fb376fed8ab4f65b670947bce35a\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/rwuqu76xsesb1.png?width=1354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=154821bb0fd7fb376fed8ab4f65b670947bce35a\" alt=\"Add thirteen days from 9/25 to convert from Julian to Gregorian. \"></a></p>\n\n<p>So if we are adding this conversion into our rubic&#39;s cube, that would mean 9/25 is also 10/8 in the Julian Calendar, since it&#39;s 13 days behind. So as a result, &quot;Chirstmas&quot; could also be on 10/8 because Christmas numbers 2125 appear in military time as a conversion of 9:25pm. </p>\n\n<p>StonksandBongs pointed out to me the inverse of the date RC tweeted the Purple heart on 8/10. Meaning it would be 10/8 if inversed. I didn&#39;t think of it that way because I assumed RC tweeted the purple heart message because on the same day, Elon Musk sold 6.9 billion worth of Tesla stock to allocate capital to finish his acquisition of Twitter so he could eventually transform it into X. I thought RC was signaling that Elon was taking a hit selling stock from his baby (Tesla)  to better everyone in the long run. But two things can be true. And the purple heart could also be the Blue and Red coming together (BBBY and GME) to make something great that others have theorized. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bk3hkozvresb1.png?width=1652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07f47cca6f386f60d8e4d7d1fdf570f5a5a51503\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/bk3hkozvresb1.png?width=1652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07f47cca6f386f60d8e4d7d1fdf570f5a5a51503\" alt=\"August 10/2022 \"></a></p>\n\n<p>Moving on, if 9/25 = Christmas in Military time and 9/25 = 10/8 in the conversion from Gregorian to Julian Calander. Then I find this RC&#39;s tweet on his father&#39;s Ted&#39;s Bday to be interesting. He captions it &quot;Superman lives forever.&quot; The original Superman, Christopher Reeve was born on 9/25 and passed away on 10/10. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3v8kq54wtesb1.png?width=1306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e0daa0131e5399736e796d99eda66353c69054f\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/3v8kq54wtesb1.png?width=1306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e0daa0131e5399736e796d99eda66353c69054f\" alt=\"Christpher Reeve 9/25\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Elon also does multiple Chirstmas tweets with familiar numbers over the few years...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rer6n29cvesb1.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=298c453856d0e759ccf6afbc1713a062eaf81bcf\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/rer6n29cvesb1.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=298c453856d0e759ccf6afbc1713a062eaf81bcf\" alt=\"Timestamps 3:17 (Teddy&#39;s Bday) and 11:47 (147)\"></a></p>\n\n<p>So remember 9/25 = Chirstmas through military time and 10/8 through Julian to Gregorian Calander. So Christmas could also be 10/8. 10/8 is also Matt Damon&#39;s birthday. Roaring Kitty has a ton of Matt Damon tweets. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/iqzy4mtyxesb1.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=befb98833175c2b0a31e82f7ed2e7b0f45e2cb80\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/iqzy4mtyxesb1.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=befb98833175c2b0a31e82f7ed2e7b0f45e2cb80\" alt=\"1. top left, Rounders movie, Damon sits at World Series of Poker. 2.

I always believed the clock was messaging through color coordination. That&#39;s why the numbers and handles were all different colors. I think the small hand is matching the color of the 1 and the long hand is matching the color of the 8. Making it 1:08. It is confirmed for me when looking on the back of &quot;The People That Make The World Go &#39;Round&quot; book. It has different colors and still matches 1:08. 1:08 could be 01/08 or also 10/08.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5k4yb3271fsb1.png?width=1466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1cf9282b53e9db78829b327d0fe72d553f822c2\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/5k4yb3271fsb1.png?width=1466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1cf9282b53e9db78829b327d0fe72d553f822c2\" alt=\"1:08 for both. \"></a></p>\n\n<p>That since it can also be 10/08 that gives us a lot to go on. Ryan Cohen also has a deleted tweet on 01/08.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9rbcp01o3fsb1.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4da360d8cfd906da6eaf781061930dc8156c087e\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/9rbcp01o3fsb1.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4da360d8cfd906da6eaf781061930dc8156c087e\" alt=\"11:47 timestamp on 1/08. He deleted soon after. 1/08 could also be 10/8\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The &quot;I have a small wee wee&quot; written backwards tweet always interested me. Back in July, I remember telling the PP discord I felt it meant messaging could be read backwards. The Cocaine bear &quot;Finally&quot; tweet also has to do with this as well. Take a look.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/axcsvogd5fsb1.png?width=1736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d562b54d06f29562e7ad28e40a4fa072d34bf97d\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/axcsvogd5fsb1.png?width=1736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d562b54d06f29562e7ad28e40a4fa072d34bf97d\" alt=\"11:30 pm Est time stamp. 11/30 date of RC \\&quot;Finally\\&quot; tweet. \\&quot;eew eew llams a evah I\\&quot; I have a small wee wee, backwards. 1:08 timestamp. \\&quot;Finally\\&quot; Tweet is 8:01 or 08/01. All could be mixed around to be the date, 10/08. Also Cocaine bear movie premiered on 4/22 which in my previous post you can see why that&#39;s significant. \"></a></p>\n\n<p>On 4/16 Roaring Kitty tweets are either celebratory or have deep meaning.

Realeyez has had a lot of great info regarding some good tinfoil there for a long time with numbers and just everything in general. StonksandBongs also helped me with the Matt Damon and exploring deeper into the purple heart. He has terrific stuff on decentralization in media. Cpt. Trips/Lancer and I have discussed Die is Cast as well and other stuff. Good stuff there he has as well. All three are great guys who have done extensive work in this saga along with so many others.

In Ryan&#39;s own word it used to cost a buck 42 before inflation :) I think him being at 224 tweets back then meant that we are right about to take off...And here we are.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/k7atfe8motrb1.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24647ddfe3e11d3a204c052eb266e1163aecb880\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/k7atfe8motrb1.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24647ddfe3e11d3a204c052eb266e1163aecb880\" alt=\"224 tweets\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pxr5tgztotrb1.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9665237d07d92cd4be5fcb4101857cbaff1834d9\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/pxr5tgztotrb1.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9665237d07d92cd4be5fcb4101857cbaff1834d9\" alt=\"Ice cream tweet on 2/24\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vbkbvib2ptrb1.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21fda4288d68b921ba0bbfb9feae04d44eb0ec7\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/vbkbvib2ptrb1.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21fda4288d68b921ba0bbfb9feae04d44eb0ec7\" alt=\"12:05 AM EST on 7/27 9:05 AM west coast time.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>His 223rd tweet came on 7/27, a year later to the day of his famous &quot;The greatest time to be alive in human history is right now&quot; tweet.

Think of it like a rubic&#39;s cube. You move things around until something clicks. </p>\n\n<p>In this instance, it&#39;s the different people/accounts using the numbers 1205. I think they used those numbers because 9:05 in military time is 21:05 or 1205. And that is relevant becuase the first ever labor day was 9/05/1882. One of the reasons for all the &#39;WORK&quot; tweets and referencing the arrival of our long awaited baby. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5lletomfqtrb1.png?width=1342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75a20d2adb6de22eba62ae0df68bcfce58d311a8\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/5lletomfqtrb1.png?width=1342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75a20d2adb6de22eba62ae0df68bcfce58d311a8\" alt=\"9/05/1882 first labor day\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5b9pbpjiqtrb1.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4b24d6374f29fa6c31724a4d892f59de78e673f\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/5b9pbpjiqtrb1.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4b24d6374f29fa6c31724a4d892f59de78e673f\" alt=\"2105 or 12:05\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Moving on to 1040.

That&#39;s when I got really excited. Because my someone I really like has something relevant to add in regards to those numbers. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0tbdazjkstrb1.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9eeebc845ff85f2a73f9a9f2f3b5e1a60568cf20\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/0tbdazjkstrb1.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9eeebc845ff85f2a73f9a9f2f3b5e1a60568cf20\" alt=\"Posted on 4/22 and from the time stamp 3:18 if you math backwards 8x13 104 or 10/04\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been excited about Elon potentially being involved a long time. Ever since I saw the Joe Rogan interview with him. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f1rlkza4ttrb1.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d91c67611fb9ebe56290a6f16fd5493ed6c26601\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/f1rlkza4ttrb1.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d91c67611fb9ebe56290a6f16fd5493ed6c26601\" alt=\"147 \"></a></p>\n\n<p>I know people have their qualms with him so I won&#39;t go too far down the Elon rabbit hole, but I encourage anyone to listen to his interviews and give him a chance. I do believe he has humanities&#39; best interest at heart along with RC and friends. There&#39;s a reason he turned around to propose a completion of acquiring twitter to make it X (and let the sink in) on October 4th... </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/musk-said-go-ahead-with-5420-share-twitter-deal-bloomberg-reporter-2022-10-04/\">https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/musk-said-go-ahead-with-5420-share-twitter-deal-bloomberg-reporter-2022-10-04/</a></p>\n\n<p>So moving on, back to Roaring Kitty. A stand-up guy and a friend to retail investors. Remember numbers can be moved around like a rubic&#39;s cube to give us an idea of where we&#39;re going. so 1040 gives us a lot to go on. So let&#39;s start with some dates, 10/04.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g2abviiyttrb1.png?width=510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=141984f67a9fc358e3fb1732c1ba851799701631\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/g2abviiyttrb1.png?width=510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=141984f67a9fc358e3fb1732c1ba851799701631\" alt=\"277th day of the year or 7/27\"></a></p>\n\n<p>October 4th (10/4) is the 277th day of the year. Or one could say 7/27 which is the tweet we touched on earlier with all the 1205 talk and &quot;All species require adversity to survive&quot; tweet. Perhaps we are close to what RC was saying on 7/27 here...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dt65soscutrb1.png?width=826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d464845216d8fdb6f8fe5e0644d805bba361c6d1\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/dt65soscutrb1.png?width=826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d464845216d8fdb6f8fe5e0644d805bba361c6d1\" alt=\"7/27\"></a></p>\n\n<p>1040, 10/4 could also be 4/01.

But for now to my favorite tweet on 4/1 with our guy DFV posting about whether he sold his GameStop position or not...He shakes the infinity magic 8 ball and reads, &quot;Concentrate and ask again...&quot; Perhaps we are going to ask again very soon. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1377772772982726657\">https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1377772772982726657</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/behwzeiewtrb1.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1796c902a493dcd940d9e34e061c0706c47d154\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/behwzeiewtrb1.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1796c902a493dcd940d9e34e061c0706c47d154\" alt=\"4/01 tweet of DFV.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Another reason I posted about Elon earlier is because he has an ultimate goal of sustainable energy. There&#39;s a lot of good info out there and I&#39;ve spoken with others about him and his companies like SpaceX and The Boring Company being making that happen. &quot;It&#39;s imperative that our civilization expand beyond Uranus&quot;. RC tweeted that once upon a time. Well, Uranus&#39; sigil is the spear of mars. OCCUPY MARS isn&#39;t just a mission for space. It&#39;s a mission to live on in peace as a species and with sustainable energy.</p>\n\n<p>I was hoping something would occur on August 2nd, 2023 because 17 years to that day Elon wrote his manifesto for the Tesla mission to his employees to take over the world.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me\">https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9wle5p0hxtrb1.png?width=1756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3738adf1494d898e4023dc536f71f4bfb00c33a8\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/9wle5p0hxtrb1.png?width=1756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3738adf1494d898e4023dc536f71f4bfb00c33a8\" alt=\"I linked it above.

A lot of us know that math is the language of the universe.

You should check it out. It&#39;s the last tweet he has on 4/01 after a bunch of the ones we went over earlier. It starts with a blackout screen and waiting and then finally pops up into this song. &quot;Never gonna give you up&quot;. I think those words hold true for him, RC, Elon etc. throughout the difficulties of this saga. We&#39;ve gone through a lot to get here but it&#39;s important to remember...All Species need adversity to survive.&quot; So we&#39;ll continue on! </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this far. There are more connections to these numbers and people I could go into but I think we end here. I&#39;m very excited about what potentially comes next. I&#39;m not saying anything will happen on these dates I&#39;ve mentioned. Just simply having fun with numbers and finding things that connect. If anything, it should just prove that we are on the right track like so many here have shown and said. My best to all of you and just remember.

It&#39;s a cyber one. A war of information and a war of numbers. Like a good sequel from a great movie, I&#39;m going to get right to it and assume you know all the amazing DD and the certain players involved: GME, BBBY, Protocol Gemini, Cyber Crew, Apple, Elon, Twitter, RC, InfiniteTruth, &quot;RC burner account&quot; C0_RY, Louie Vutton, Metaverse, Meme Basket, etc. I will be going over some of these, but not all. I&#39;m hoping this is just a place to vomit all my thoughts, rather than a completed picture. This is just to add to the conversation that smarter people than I have laid before me and hopefully extend the conversation in a direction that leads to more depth and insight. </p>\n\n<p>Also, it&#39;s mostly screenshots because I believe Twitter is a map to lead us to our answers. They are giving us truth unlike the false narrative and propaganda we&#39;ve had our whole lives. We just need to look. Even if it&#39;s non-linear, I believe a plan has been in motion for a long time and they have left us clues along the way.

And Cybercrew is a big part of that too.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vuhc991n7lva1.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebd97c25f19954f9bb840dc1cb10e625d451f726\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/vuhc991n7lva1.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebd97c25f19954f9bb840dc1cb10e625d451f726\" alt=\"Along with Loopring, which is with GME.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0sj2q5kr7lva1.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f49c2233ca4046c45831dba8395db032c5c1552\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/0sj2q5kr7lva1.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f49c2233ca4046c45831dba8395db032c5c1552\" alt=\"It&#39;s all connected. \"></a></p>\n\n<p>Anyways, that&#39;s all I have today. You can call it tinfoil or whatever but I would call it connecting the dots and looking at things from a different perspective. That&#39;s all reality and life is anyways...One&#39;s perspective. I wanted to get into Elon and his conveniently timed takeover of Twitter. Apple and the Ichan&#39;s. Hyperblu7 with recursive backtracking and 7.4,1. Knotty Llama, etc. but maybe that&#39;s for another time.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that this is all so much bigger than any one of us. It has been years, if not decades in the making. I consider myself very lucky to have stumbled into it and own both GME and BBBY. It&#39;s a wild life and I think we&#39;re all here because we never gave up and we hope to build a better life, not just for ourselves, but other we care about too. I hope to continue on this journey a better man than I was the day before. And I wish the same for all of you. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>But I got one last thing that actually is tinfoil but I like it anyways...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x5hdmp9w8lva1.png?width=1410&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fd6312dd91678e6dd972a37e56162568da5097b\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/x5hdmp9w8lva1.png?width=1410&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fd6312dd91678e6dd972a37e56162568da5097b\" alt=\"I think this post of Ryan&#39;s speaks a lot. Many different interpretations, but for me, at least the bottom right seems clear. RC (GME) is holding a blue shirt guy (BBBY) with a child (Baby). The child is holding a gme bag like RC. That&#39;s him aquiring Baby from BBBY? Just a fun tinfoil thought with no backing lol.\"></a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "", "text_color": "", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/lNMrOtlFRpIem1u_Eht_nq3DJ0EKeMlaKX6o88cEauM.jpg\"/></div>"}]
