I remember being taught that it was because gold was \u201cto slow to ship across the ocean\u201d.  The govt couldnt make currency fast enough, because they \u201chad to wait for the gold to arrive\u201d.  which limited growth.  They argued using a fiat system not backed by gold would allow more gdp growth because we wouldnt have to wait for gold to \u201csettle\u201d on US shores.  </p>\n\n<p>Its a crock of shit.  Its not because \u201cit took to long to ship gold\u201d it was because it was too hard to manipulate the supply of gold, allowing us to outprint the rest of the world.  Im assuming there were probably \u201cfails to deliver\u201d of gold too, but it\u2019s easier to find out where the gold went versus where the extra printed money went.  It\u2019s hard to say gold is in 2 places at the same time!  To make that easier, the govt just went away with this currency standard.  In the name of growth.  </p>\n\n<p>Immutable supply networks will rule the next age of governing and financial systems, because we made it impossible to do the thing that people in control always do: manipulate the supply of a currency so know one knows how much their currency is worth.
