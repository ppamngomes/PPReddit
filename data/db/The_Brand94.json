She also talked about brand recognition and what that means in the current economy. BBBY is going through an immense transformation and what comes out on the other end very well might only be buybuyBaby.</p>\n\n<p>The value of a brand to me is what kind of culture you get when shopping there whether it be online or at the store. What is the company known for, how well do they execute, and how reputable/functional/durable are their products.</p>\n\n<p>RC obviously saw true value in buybuyBaby. He highlighted the online presence is his OG letter which Holly touched on being a very important facet for retail companies nowadays in a separate recent interview.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to also highlight the value of the community surrounding BBBY. You have loyal customers with 20M+ registered rewards members and you have loyal investors and some exist in both columns. If somehow BBBY makes it out of chapter 11 or gets bought out, I think that someone will likely see the value of the whole community and they would be foolish not to. How the potential acquirer keeps people loyal is another story. Regardless we have to hope the equity portion of the company is valued in the sense of the community of investors here, the BBBY sub, and other places. Throw us a bone or scratch our backs one last time and keep us on the hook so to speak. You offer 60,000+ regards a life raft that is better than a pack of smokes and half a sandwich, guess what, you also get the loyalty of those people who will literally keep throwing money into whatever you\u2019re selling. At least that\u2019s my opinion, seeing as mostly everyone still here keeps buying more shares and products lol \ud83d\ude02 </p>\n\n<p>The loyalty of this community and others like it will hopefully be a factor for consideration. There is immense value in the form of loyal investors and loyal customers. Hopefully you all recognize the value of this community and the continued growth and expansion of it!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "I'm a grownup", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Beginning in December 2022, Lazard commenced a process to solicit interest in a going-concern sale transaction that could be effectuated in chapter 11, as well as to solicit interest in providing postpetition financing. Lazard initially reached out to a group of potential financial and strategic investors who are experienced in investing in the retail sector, operational turnarounds and/or distressed situations and held meetings with certain of those investors in late December 2022. This initial group was comprised of approximately twenty investors, nine of which had executed nondisclosure agreements (\u201cNDAs\u201d) by the second week of January 2023. Those parties included various financial sponsors, strategic buyers, and money center banks. Several of the parties contacted could have potentially been acquirors of some or all of the Company\u2019s businesses, as well as providers of postpetition financing to fund a going-concern reorganization.\n74. In mid-January 2023, efforts to identify a potential plan sponsor and investors to provide postpetition financing intensified, the universe of potential investors that Lazard engaged with expanded, and diligence continued. The Company also received unsolicited inbounds from potential third-party financing sources who had some level of interest in potentially providing postpetition financing. By the end of the month, it became apparent that the process was unlikely to yield a plan sponsor that would facilitate a going-concern reorganization. By that time, Lazard had engaged with approximately 60 potential investors to solicit interest in serving as a plan sponsor, acquiring some or all of the Debtors\u2019 assets or businesses, or providing postpetition financing, and 30 of those parties had executed NDAs.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "I'm a grownup", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I am here to elaborate and reflect on this glorious quote. Everyone has been saying nothing makes sense here. Why the dilution and why does it seem like the board has been literally sandbagging the entire operation? Well, for starters its possible they indirectly intended to make this company look as bad as possible. Why do that?</p>\n\n<p>If a company wants to be acquired then dilution and making the current situation look as terrible as possible can also act beneficially for the acquirer by creating an undervalued market cap. By diluting the shares that they have, they opened themselves up and left themselves defenseless by any means to a takeover or private sale at least until May 9th. Every filing up to this point has been mostly bearish and combine shorting with active dilution and we arrive at our current share price and also market cap. However, someone can now buy the entire company for a reasonable price, and no one has the voting power or ownership to stop that event from happening. As Roach said in one of the PPShow streams it&#39;s go time and their anti-takeover measures are no longer applicable.</p>\n\n<p>My guess as well is that the acquirer had some stipulations to this whole agreement. Such as closing down unprofitable areas of the company, layoffs, and paying down some of the debt. The weighted majority of closures have been related to Bed Bath and Beyond legacy stores and not as many buybuyBaby Stores. </p>\n\n<p>Going back and rereading the Ryan Cohen letter to the board, I would direct you to these statements,</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;At bottom, cracks have emerged in Bed Bath\u2019s overly ambitious strategy. Leadership should assess whether  a shrinking small-cap retailer with a modest cash position and nearly $1.2 billion in debt can afford to roll  the dice.</em> <strong><em>We believe Bed Bath needs to narrow its focus to fortify operations and maintain the right  inventory mix to meet demand, while simultaneously exploring strategic alternatives that include  separating buybuy Baby, Inc. (\u201cBABY\u201d) and a full sale of the Company.&quot;</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Well wouldn&#39;t you know it, that part about &quot;maintaining the right inventory&quot; looks to be addressed or the start of it with that press release we got about the consignment inventory program. The store closure lists provided by the company kind of allude to this part of the letter as well. These next two quotes from the letter are important to note and one can draw their own conclusions and correlations to our current situation...</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;In the event Bed Bath pursued a full or partial sale of BABY, it could position itself to pay off debt,  put cash on the balance sheet and continue reducing its share count, thereby creating significant value  for shareholders.</em> <strong><em>Spinning off shares of BABY would be an even more efficient way to transfer value  to shareholders. Notably, BABY\u2019s high online penetration would likely ease operational hurdles. We  assume Bed Bath and BABY could still have a shared services agreement to maintain an omnichannel  experience for customers.&quot;</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>&quot;Evaluate a Full Sale to a Well-Capitalized Acquirer \u2013 The final path we want to raise for  consideration is a full sale of Bed Bath, in its current form, to one of the many well-capitalized financial  sponsors with track records in the retail and consumer sectors and the ability to pay a meaningful  premium. The past 10 years have shown that Bed Bath faces a difficult existence in the public market. The market is not giving the Company nearly enough credit for BABY\u2019s value. A sale that can lock in a substantial premium for shareholders and provide Bed Bath the flexibility of the private market could  be an ideal outcome for customers, employees and investors.&quot;</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I believe past posts have covered this, but as it relates to the Pitchbook DD I have read, they have explored the options of a full sale. Typically, in my experience, it&#39;s the law of three. A company needs to at least consider three offers before moving forward. I would have to dive back into some filings, but I think there was some mention of this.</p>\n\n<p>So, let&#39;s evaluate where we are in comparison to this plan. The company no longer has the authorized, but unissued shares to circumvent a takeover and will not until May 9th. The controlling power and voting ownership has now decreased enough that if someone has planned this, they get a good deal from it and there is nothing able to stop it. BBBY has been paying down debt, trimming the fat/unproductive areas, kept buybuyBaby reasonably protected throughout all of this, shrunk its legacy store footprint, and now we have consignment inventory to help keep inventory levels manageable and more efficient. It looks like Ryan Cohen&#39;s letter/plan has been getting carried out.</p>\n\n<p>I will leave you all with this. Ryan Cohen never meant to personally join the board of BBBY and drive the initiatives of the letter. However, he did nominate board members on his behalf and likely people he trusted to carry the intentions out. Those board members were not forcefully removed and I believe they left on their own accord when their job/goal was completed. It is the endgame now and the stage is set. If and when May 9th rolls around and we potentially haven&#39;t gotten any news, my theory will change. Good luck to all and see what the coming weeks bring us!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>&quot;Hopefully leadership acts with urgency to implement the aforementioned suggestions. Given that I am the  Chairman of GameStop and overseeing a systematic transformation, I am not in a position to join Bed  Bath\u2019s Board and personally drive the initiatives outlined in this letter. This does not mean, however, that  RC Ventures will not seek to hold the Board and management accountable if necessary.&quot;</em></strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "I'm a grownup", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Fr-oBxE7DPDwDr1CqB7bL0KBp0wnuBkn-T52h4olKJ0.jpg\"/></div>"},

A company going bankrupt is still paying someone to write up immaterial fucking information for investors to see? Like what&#39;s the point. What&#39;s the point of switching proxy companies and paying more if capital expenditure is an issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good luck to all you fucking degenerates!</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "I'm a grownup", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/fs0jVpw44K4qMxA5b4TvmT9lw6mbLMH9w-xOqIOAQ2o.jpg\"/></div>"},

The BBBY Sub (General Discussion/Observations)", "text": "From my knowledge and reading the filing for the additional shares, that is essentially part of the original offering. \n\nAs Roach kind of foretold or at least as I understood him, the warrants have been terminated and looks like the revised offering/prospectus reduced the overall outstanding shares included in the original offering from 900M to 807M and could likely be the result of the termination of the warrants. I believe that BBBY will still have those shares, but as the filing looks and reads, they reduced the outstanding per the offering. They paid off some of their debt, but not all of it. \n\nI saw another post here in regards to the New York Law and Some By-Law Provisions saying that this would bar an M/A which in reality as I read it, does not do that. If it\u2019s being done in prescribed manner and as Hal Roach conjectured that is likely being done in this way, then this is just blanket statement within the prospectus to cover that. I\u2019m interested to hear his perspective on the timing/release of the filings as it pertains to his thesis. \n\nThis is my general opinion as well, but a lot language/clauses got updated. \n\nWe got a lot more than just updated prospectus and offering of shares through B Riley today. The letter to HBC needs to be looked at as well as the other attachments.", "flair": {"text": "", "text_color": "", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
