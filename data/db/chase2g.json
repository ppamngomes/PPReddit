I have evidence that suggests he either read some of them or completely disregarded them. He liked this post by this person 15 hours ago. David Kastin has time to be on LinkedIn? I thought he was busy with BK paperwork to submit the 10K on time?</p>\n\n<p>Edit 1: he liked another post from 5 hours ago. Wtf??? Why he is casually browsing and liking LinkedIn posts?? Go to his LinkedIn activity to see for yourself. I really hope the deal is done and he\u2019s relaxing. If not, I\u2019m suing the whole board starting with Sue.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
