I can say, i was a little shocked, almost like the closing the final chapter of a good book.  However, I got to thinking, with all the great minds and strong conviction in here, are we really that far off.  The thesis, if correct, cant come to an end by liquidating our shares, and saying it&#39;s over.  This would be the worst way for a story to end.  It would almost be like saying, &quot;He Dead, The End&quot;.  There&#39;s gotta be more substance to this. So I dug...and here&#39;s what I am looking at.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ri7naueol0vb1.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fe3bfa1a0f33d479789c0ab2787bee8efce12d9\">https://preview.redd.it/ri7naueol0vb1.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fe3bfa1a0f33d479789c0ab2787bee8efce12d9</a></p>\n\n<p>This quote is what I believe what we are seeing.  We are seeing brokerages slowly take back the shares. These requests aren&#39;t coming from brokerages, these requests are coming from the Depository which in our case is Cede &amp; Co.  This why you are seeing Webull, MooMoo and others still being holders of the stock. We knew last week that the DRS&quot;d community had issues with trying to find out where the shares were located, and if we had a transfer agent change.  There has yet to be any clarification on that.  This would also back up my thesis that Cede &amp; Co is trying to get an exact total because there are many that are swimming naked.  What way would be more accurate then halt trading, take back the shares deeming them worthless, only to find the corrupt SOB&#39;s holding the bag.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, this Tweet by Ryan Cohen my have substance:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jayc9jl1n0vb1.png?width=514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6943fe1961f25658ba4baf21ca950ff5ae0200c9\">https://preview.redd.it/jayc9jl1n0vb1.png?width=514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6943fe1961f25658ba4baf21ca950ff5ae0200c9</a></p>\n\n<p>This might be revering to the Tide going out at night, and coming back in the morning.  RC posted this gem April 13th, 2022.  This date is significant because it represent tide change based on Lunar (Moon) Phases.  The call these spring tides.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kxwf79e6o0vb1.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7ecfd80ef3dca9adc3883ee270258c435a2a055\">https://preview.redd.it/kxwf79e6o0vb1.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7ecfd80ef3dca9adc3883ee270258c435a2a055</a></p>\n\n<p>Hence, I feel we are about to see whose swimming naked.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I wanted to know why all brokerages wouldn&#39;t just delete the shares immediately after the 8-k was filed.  Nothing was changed, and they knew back then what the supposed outcome was, then why wait?  No information has changed.  Who were the mixed messages from?  25$ per share buyout, Options advancing towards 10/20 on all strikes, and a new company name DK-Butterfly with multiple entities.  </p>\n\n<p>Rc Tweets this:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/srzwxlyip0vb1.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a76fb7d2174c4f98813d147d7d095898e9160c8\">https://preview.redd.it/srzwxlyip0vb1.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a76fb7d2174c4f98813d147d7d095898e9160c8</a></p>\n\n<p>In the 1960&#39;s the stock market had turbulent times.  With trading volumes at an all time high, firms had the impossible task of keeping track of all the transactions.  The &quot;Paperwork Crunch&quot; began and as markets began to shift, firms were getting knocked out left and right going broke. Many called it a pillow fight between firms in what was known as the swinging sixties.  Here&#39;s the article:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hlzzet79q0vb1.png?width=769&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c880ddcd86a4bc9dc81fbcd0cc8a3e9cdbe86b77\">https://preview.redd.it/hlzzet79q0vb1.png?width=769&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c880ddcd86a4bc9dc81fbcd0cc8a3e9cdbe86b77</a></p>\n\n<p>As uncomfortable i am with everything surround this, my conviction remains unwavering.  Of course, if wrong, it will hurt and I will probably need some therapy, but until i figure out who and what DK Butterfly stand for, I remain zen.  This has been a experience of epic proportions.  PP, i thank god I found the show. ABC, you were the Robin to Batman, and your business knowledge and calming sense is priceless. Michael, Travis, Plur, Sal, and Jake2B, you are wise apes capable of creating movements.  No matter what happens in this play, we look forward to the next battle, rich or still trying to get rich.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Peace out Apes</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-kfoJW-oTWfoLI5Cfi68mieXjfwPUXwwKdHYE0PykDg.jpg\"/></div>"},

This mission is gathering steam, and wanted to share the what i think is about to happen...</p>\n\n<p>We know many things, but those things come and go, and we lose track of them.  Where is the earnings?  We still have not seem anything or heard anything.  What&#39;s the reason for the delay?</p>\n\n<p>Next, as the title says, Teddy Holdings LLC.  I think RC and his master plan is all coming together.  Teddy Holdings filed Trademarks in the household industry back in August of 2022 right before RC split, causing a panic.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u81rxo7glm0b1.png?width=944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f63097f867cb03499b8e2480fcb792969ad713fd\">Via trademarks.Justia.com</a></p>\n\n<p>I find this interesting and totally related to BBBY as the applications applied for are mostly of the components that BBBY sells.  Searching under each serial number, gives International Class codes of 21 and 42.  If you dive in, you will find that these are direct providers facilitating goods and services to our beloved company.  Some of the companies that have been added since this trademark were updated less then 30 days ago.  So can someone tell me why Teddy Holdings would file a trademark for Goods and Services, unless they had plans to buy a company that currently sells some of these products?  </p>\n\n<p>After further pondering, I wanted to do a little research on Westpoint Home, Carl Icahn&#39;s conglomerate.  I found that Westpoint Homes uses many of the same International Codes that Teddy applied for.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h841c0honm0b1.png?width=256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78b772b88ad4e92fe6800f9b202132475c1e9d4b\">https://preview.redd.it/h841c0honm0b1.png?width=256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78b772b88ad4e92fe6800f9b202132475c1e9d4b</a></p>\n\n<p>So, is there a chance that Brett resigning from Newell and selling his stake at a loss, was because Teddy Holdings is going to buy them up as well?  I mean, Carl is getting long toothed so to speak.  This picture might speak a 1000 words.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jgrt064gom0b1.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e54e5bd93a046183bbda0b672ade4a55ce42c3d\">Together again</a></p>\n\n<p>This might be a huge transaction and a far stretch, but what if...what if Icahn sells, RC scoops up both Newell, BBBY, Baby, to start an Amazon like experience?  To me, there is more to this than Just BBBY.  When you think business plan, you don&#39;t think about a certain class to sell goods and service to, you thin about the whole pie.  What better way then to have baby goods, middle class goods, and a higher end to serve all your customers.  I think RC, Larry, Little Icahn and possibly Pulte all have skin in the game.  I am on the fence with Pulte after his screenshot of his DRS&#39;d shares of GME, which could label him as an insider.  Either way, I think we come out smelling like roses.  200k cost basis .0797, 100k DRS&#39;s holding for multi-million dollar status or a Wendy&#39;s dumpster.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/paiz2iispm0b1.png?width=398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d08a9301cf29b3966f460cb303a0866e6acd82e5\">https://preview.redd.it/paiz2iispm0b1.png?width=398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d08a9301cf29b3966f460cb303a0866e6acd82e5</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/k_wSNmxS1q6Ud57NoWkmdX-rRH8n7OC_xN9UKqUMGes.jpg\"/></div>"},
