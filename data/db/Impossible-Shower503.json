As of now, we know that the voting and opt out deadline is scheduled for September 1, 2023, for the plan which is not yet finalized. Could it be that this date is the one being extended? If not, What is this extension for specifically?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff4500"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
