It's absurd that he would take a position in GME, but on the other hand, say he think's bbbyq is 'interesting' and then not partake.  \n\nTHEREFORE, I believe this is a subtle tell that he has no vested interest.  \n\nLastly, he kept harping on DRS so I think I'll DRS some shares, especially after the Fidelity scare today.\n\nNot financial advice, don't even think about taking action based on my writing, pure SWAG at this point but interesting none-the-less.", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
