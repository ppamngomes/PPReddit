Say they are going to get 0.10c then an offer of 0.11c to purchase the debt in order to continue the business and preserve the NOL is the best deal on the table. </p>\n\n<p>To preserve the NOL company has continue as on going concern.

Some suggestions treasury has 412 million. \n\nWhat if BBBY who sold the name to overstock order granted last hearing. \n\nBbby restructuring under chapter 11,  as BBBaby new name obviously a viable stand alone enterprise.   Devil in the details overstock have bought the name not the Trademark,  bbby hasn't changed ownership just changed name preservation of the NOL. \nAs BBB share swap bbby to bbb forcing shorts to close? \n\nIs this possible?", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
