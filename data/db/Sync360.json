We&#39;ll explore its digital footprint, SEO, value, and redesign, and also touch on why it&#39;s drawing interest from big players like Ryan Cohen, Newell Brands and Carl Icahn.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this document is to provide a digital perspective of the Brand, supported by data. This should help investors understand why an M&amp;A makes sense for anyone looking to enter the mass market retailers space.</p>\n\n<p>I won\u2019t go into Buy Buy Baby just yet\u2026that\u2019ll come in a later benchmark in this series.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7i6sljsezuya1.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c667d11d17bc35b6074a2e8f049287a86a7b3cce\">12/1/22 bedbathandbeyond.com</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Digital/Social Footprint</strong> Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has a strong digital footprint, with a significant online presence on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. They also have a well-optimized website that ranks highly on Google, with over 10.6 million backlinks from authoritative sources.</p>\n\n<p>Those familiar with Search Engine Optimization (SEO), you know that a website&#39;s authority score depends on its legitimate backlinks, content, and age. It takes a long time to build up a site to this caliber, and it requires a significant investment of resources to create content, optimize the site, and obtain backlinks.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/sxk9avykzuya1.png?width=997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efbb51e39c6f76496c5216ca87d82ea487954fda\">SEMRUSH Data</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Authority Score-</strong> 83 is extremely difficult to get. Top score is 100.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Organic Search Traffic -</strong> 12.6M they hit 22.3M in the past year which would could be reached fairly easily with SEO optimization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Paid Search Traffic -</strong> 20K As you can see paid search is very low compared to the Organic Search Traffic. This is actually a good sign as they have less digital marketing overhead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backlinks-</strong> A foundation of 10.6M is an excellent starting point for growth. This number can be increased by interlinking authoritative sites, such as other Newell brand sites like Elmer&#39;s, Rubbermaid, Sharpie, and so on. I will discuss this strategy further in part 2.</p>\n\n<p>With the right strategy, the Authority score can reach 99. Once this happens, it becomes fairly simple to get any product keyword to the top of page 1 in Google, resulting in increased free organic traffic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Traffic/SEO</strong></p>\n\n<p>Without delving into the technical aspects of SEO, the ultimate goal of any online retail SEO strategy is to generate massive amounts of quality traffic that leads to sales. For example, <a href=\"http://bedbathandbeyond.com/\">bedbathandbeyond.com</a> received an estimated 22.3M - 12.6M users per month.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q2u9dg7pzuya1.png?width=546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a0561a4069d8942c7e7cc9724366612b3ea5dbe\">SEMRUSH Data</a></p>\n\n<p>With a large number of users coming from free organic traffic (not paid traffic), online retailers should be able to convert those visitors into a good amount of sales.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Although most of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#39;s sales still come from its physical stores, online customers tend to spend more on average. In June 2022, online customers spent an average of $116 per month, compared to retail customers who spent an average of $80. As of June 2022, 27 percent of the company&#39;s sales were generated through the online channel, an increase from only 15% in June 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Online spending is on the rise.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/bed-bath-and-beyond-nasdaq-bbby-earnings-miss-online-retail-spending/\">https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/bed-bath-and-beyond-nasdaq-bbby-earnings-miss-online-retail-spending/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xrohme7tzuya1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10d4d04564807a269764322a1a4938affda2a48f\">SEMRUSH Data</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ikftq9fvzuya1.png?width=535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d955322b110eb5a3cff749c769e4d76bc423be9b\">SEMRUSH Data</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>All of the organic traffic has come from the 3M+ organic keywords that have been seeded in Google&#39;s algorithm since the site&#39;s inception until now. The value of these keywords comes from their top placement in Google search results, which connect users to all the products that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond carries on its robust e-commerce store.</p>\n\n<p>As the site undergoes an overhaul and is optimized for faster download speeds, better SEO, and user experience, the pool of organic keywords will grow. This will result in more sales and opportunities for conversions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UX/UI/User Journey</strong></p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t go into detail about the UX/UI of <a href=\"http://bedbathandbeyond.com/\">bedbathandbeyond.com</a>, but there are many opportunities to improve the user experience, user journey, and design of the site. These improvements will likely be pushed forward in the near future to optimize every touchpoint and product relevance for the visitors, ultimately increasing sales volume and capturing a larger piece of the market.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Social Accounts</strong></p>\n\n<p>We all know that a social matters and its necessary for any brand that tries to survive online. As you can see Bed Bath and Beyond has established a significant presence online which is also used to sell products, offers, and stays in contact with the user base.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y3ismff30vya1.png?width=626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bdcfb4786f77b14b0e1734e23bf75ad1577a1ce\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/y3ismff30vya1.png?width=626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bdcfb4786f77b14b0e1734e23bf75ad1577a1ce\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Based on the numbers there&#39;s huge potential in creating an online retailer that can leverage past and existing marketing efforts for new products and a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Welcome Rewards Members</strong></p>\n\n<p>Total of <del>6.4</del> <strong>16 million</strong> members since launching. Another free marketing channel that can be leveraged for promotions/traffic/sales.</p>\n\n<p>Update: 6.4 &gt; 16M members</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong></p>\n\n<p>When it comes to brick and mortar stores, marketing costs are typically higher because they require physical advertising, such as billboards, flyers, and local events. These can be effective in generating foot traffic to a physical store, but they can also be costly. In addition, traditional marketing efforts like television and radio ads can be expensive, especially for small businesses.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, e-commerce stores have the advantage of being able to leverage digital marketing channels, such as social media, email marketing, and pay-per-click advertising. These channels can be highly targeted and cost-effective, allowing businesses to reach a larger audience at a lower cost. E-commerce businesses can also take advantage of search engine optimization (SEO) tactics to rank higher on search engines and drive organic traffic to their sites.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the cost-effectiveness of marketing for brick and mortar vs. e-commerce stores depends on several factors, such as the size of the business, the target audience, and the marketing goals. While brick and mortar stores may have higher initial costs for marketing, they can still be effective in generating local brand awareness and driving foot traffic. In contrast, e-commerce businesses can reach a broader audience at a lower cost.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Potential Benefits for Newell Brands and Carl Icahn</strong> Newell Brands and Carl Icahn may be interested in acquiring Bed Bath &amp; Beyond because it could provide a platform to sell their existing brands. Newell Brands owns several household brands, including Calphalon, FoodSaver, and Sharpie, but does not currently have an online retail platform to house them. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#39;s website could provide the necessary platform to sell these brands online, increasing their visibility and potential sales. Additionally, Carl Icahn has a history of investing in struggling companies and improving their financial performance, which could be a valuable asset for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Note: If you look at all the brands under newell you will notice that every single brand could go into the <a href=\"http://bedbathandbeyond.com/\">bedbathandbeyond.com</a> store. This means larger profit margins for each brand and creates a synergy bridging all the brands under one roof.</p>\n\n<p>Building a successful online retail platform like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#39;s requires a significant investment of time and resources. It can take months or even years to develop a website with a smooth user experience, fast loading times, and effective SEO. Additionally, establishing an online presence as extensive as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#39;s requires billions of dollars in investment over the years. By acquiring <a href=\"http://bedbathandbeyond.com/\">bedbathandbeyond.com</a> Icahn could shortcut all of this and go straight to market.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/e8j6znz80vya1.png?width=1036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffe7dd17f73fcb6449cc2ce38a712d53fb911853\">May 9, 2023 Newell Brands</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>About me</strong></p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m a marketing strategist and creative director for really big companies\u2026and some small ones too.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been in this play since August and have invested my life savings into it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n\n<p>As always, it&#39;s important to remember that this information is not financial advice.
