I came on PPs show last winter when it was just PP and ABC and was probably the first to suggest that what is playing out right now would happen, my thesis being that RC was targeting these companies like GME and BBBY to turn around not because he loves videogames or home goods, but because these are over-shorted stocks that would hold great potential for upward pressure if they could survive and endure, maybe being attached to an entirely new operation/ticker. While most of the kooks on this sub were talking about legit turnaround plans like reducing store count, bringing in new product lines, and going on shopping excursions to show your support, supporting Sue Gove like the AMC nuts support Adam Aron, etc, I myself believed that none of this was going to help, and that an efficient liquidation would take place in which we reduced our costs/debt as much as possible before the big change happened. Lo and behold, here we are.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>On the show back then, I said that IF the shorts were forced to close at some point, they may turn off the buy button, and that if I were the shorts, I would let the stock run a bit so low buyers might exit, crush it back down again, let it run again, crush it back down, etc, creating a sense of hopelessness and doom, so when it does run higher, people will be thanking the heavens to have their opportunity to exit with a small profit. Put yourself in the shorts place; they have good algos, they probably have shares to buy back, so it&#39;s a matter of how long you can hold before you crack. Remember how GME ran, with many ups and downs, over several days, before the button was turned off. Hopefully shorts will really be forced to close fast and hard; would be nice to wake up to a buyout at 80/share.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get greedy; this whole play is most likely being overseen by the government, as much as you would like to hope, there are specific reasons they are allowing this thing to go on, RC has his own connections and we seem to have some big money on our side, government will NOT allow a bunch of kooks to crash the global financial system, it&#39;s just not going to happen, so get over it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>IMO we were on our way to run to 60-80 before we got kneecapped, that&#39;s my target price, but since we dropped lower, there are many people who own shares in the pennies and I don&#39;t see Sundevil holding until he&#39;s a billionaire, but who knows? We have done a good job of holding and waiting out the pressure, we can tell from the shilling all over the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I still believe AMC is connected somehow and will need to be dealt with, eventually. Those execs suck and they need a hostile takeover. Still hoping RC or another friendly buys a stake and starts putting pressure on.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Good luck to all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83d\udd34 Negative Nancy \ud83d\udd34", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Sales, debt, NOLs, assets, distribution centers, none of these really matter; the team will cut a ton of fat, get costs way down, and keep what they want. Even if we have to spend a few billion wiping out the debt, there is probably tens of billions stuck in the short positions. Apes keep buying the stock while it becomes harder and harder for shorts to reset their swaps/positions and kick the can. Even with some dilution, if these stocks are shorted like we think they are, there is no escape as long as the stocks themselves keep trading and simply get moved onto the newer, better entity.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that so many shills spend so much time endlessly replying to us, yelling at us to explain what assets are left, how we&#39;re soon going to zero, I&#39;ve never seen so many humans spend so much time on something that doesn&#39;t concern them, and it&#39;s quite bullish. Maybe if they just shut up, then some people would lose interest and decide not to buy in that day. My only concern is how long it will take to see some progress, and how much rebound we will get in the share price.</p>\n\n<p>Come on, team, let&#39;s hurry it up!

The real price of our shares has been estimated to be between anywhere from 60/share to 5k/share.

I believe we can do this through the sheer force of will. In the dating world this is called \"Manifesting.\" Apes can do this through the legal system and banking system through a series of steps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. As a group, contact our brokerages and under the threat of legal action, demand our share price be revalued to the true amount.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. If brokers do not capitulate, approach our respective banks and explain to them that the price is wrong due to crime, that a drastic rise in share price is inevitable and imminent, and that the value of our shares should be adjusted accordingly to our beliefs. Once the banks are on our side, we should have access to the true valuation of our wealth.
