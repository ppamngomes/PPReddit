Like a little hobby to photoshop pictures and occupied my time. But inwas inspired to make this just now because the wolves are always praised even though they are the bad guys and the Activist are look over even though they push fornmy equality for the average person like us.\nI feel that in the near future when more stocks squeeze and abundance is flowing and us apes feel better with more money that we start to wash away the separation of plays and support one another. \nWe don&#39;t have to agree on all plays and have different view points on what we think will squeeze and won&#39;t. But never should we attack each other. We may not agree on one play but might agree on a different one and do the push one it together. \nThe goal i believe is to change the narrative of naked shorting and illegal aspecsn that&#39;s going on in the market.\nWell i personally want BBBY GME AMC and all other companies thats being victimized to squeeze. America was founded on a multitude of corporations not conglomerate companies thats crushing competition. I say all this with positive energy please save all the negativity for another post. I want all of you rich and live in abundance for your family.
