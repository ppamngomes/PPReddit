This cusip drama happened with MMTLP as well and those who held shares in brokers did not receive their shares in the merger. Instead they were given placeholders with a wide range of cusips and it was a goose chase to get your placeholders DRS\u2019d at AST (along with a $500 fee to do so which discouraged many investors). I hope this isnt interpreted as FUD but rather proof / evidence of fraud, you are entitled to your shares in the event of a merger / acquisition and this community has a bigger voice if events were to follow MMTLP\u2019s.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83c\udf49 Watermelon Lover \ud83c\udf49 ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pm0NrK2-JF4/maxresdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCIAKENAF8quKqQMa8AEB-AGsBYACgAqKAgwIABABGGUgZShlMA8=&rs=AOn4CLDttv8J2a3wYXRpJc0d3VBxcPvwDQ\"/></div>"},
