I&#39;d like to meet you one day, it would be great to have a M&amp;A. I know I can&#39;t trade as fast as you but I think you&#39;d be impressed with my speed. I love your hair, you hodl fast. Did you have a good relationship with Wall Street? Me neither. These are all things we can talk about and more. I know you have not been getting my letters because I know you would write back if you did. I hope you write back this time, and we can become good friends. I am sure our relationship would be a real squeeze!</p>\n\n<p>-ape</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
