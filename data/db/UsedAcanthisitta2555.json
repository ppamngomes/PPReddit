Make me happy, so I can buy a car, propose to my girlfriend, start my own business, buy lots of food for my dog, and pay off all my debts.\n\nThe only thing I can offer you in gratitude is a video of my dog playing with her ball. Otherwise, you will not receive anything else. NOTE: This is not a scam attempt, because I tell you in advance that I have nothing to give you. All I ask is that you send me ETH.  0x6860e29b304F9f6280b5D582EB1e71cA6E6785Db ", "flair": {"text": "Memes :d", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#7193ff"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/LtiB7NmrHMs9LP0qxQRfofrA3ucZG73i4TJXxLUB4Ek.jpg\"/></div>"}]
