Why the fuck are we so unprepared to face his bullshit? Stop character assassination, actually listen to his shit and disprove it. We aren't an echo chamber and we should be able to face conflicting information head on.\n\nI feel like we should have him back on and poke holes in his theory in the same way he has targeted us.\n\nLet me start by something that Carter raised but didn't quite put it in a good way:\n\n1. Why is Marantz spouting shit that aligns with the FUDster media? Like for reals man, the same guys who said GME go burger king is your allies now? Doesn't make sense to me considering the fact GME proved they were wrong.\n\n2. I think another point was something ABC raised, not sure though, was about how he was spouting speculation as fact. He says that our BOD is compromised but apart from the links to Apollo and PE, marantz isn't able to directly identify what actions that our actors took to create the demise. It could be just as likely that they are experienced with PE and how to fight them based on their pasts. Without knowing what they actively did to cause the downfall of the company, isn't he just bullshitting?\n\n3. He makes a point that all the companies they are involved in goes BK. But how does someone like David Kastin's record compare to other's in the company restructuring and turn around sector? If he goes into companies and finds ways to revitalise them enough they survive a bit longer and he leaves and they die, is it solely his fault or are depressed companies just very likely to die anyway? Without the comparison and stat's to back it up, how do we know they are significantly worse BOD?\n\n4. Retail in general are struggling, are we surprised that their previous experience has been in companies that goes BK? Would you be surprised if someone in tech knows people who know how to code? BK is just something that retailers have been suffering with the rise of ecommerce. \n\nAnyway I think there is value in grilling this fucker, but be prepared rather than taking small jabs about his cockpuckered lips (which is true, they do pucker like that). I mean, keep it civil and concentrated and evaluate his thesis properly.", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
