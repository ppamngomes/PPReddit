Ken was known for his unusual and somewhat eccentric taste in food. While most people enjoyed the traditional combinations, Ken had a peculiar fondness for mayo-filled butthole\u2019s and cock.\n\nThe townsfolk couldn't understand why Ken had such an odd culinary preference. Some thought he had simply lost his taste buds, while others believed he was playing an elaborate prank. However, Ken had a secret reason behind his unique cravings.\n\nYears ago, Ken was a struggling con-artist trying to make ends meet. He would spend countless hours in his office, Masterbating over his worker\u2019s. However, inspiration often eluded him, leaving him frustrated and disheartened.\n\nOne day, as Ken stared at his rotten cock, he decided to take a break and went to the local diner for a meal. The only option available was mayo-laden butthole\u2019s and a massive cock for dessert. Hungry and desperate, Ken decided to give it a try.\n\nTo his surprise, as he took a bite of the mayo-filled butthole and followed it up with a lick of the massive cock, something magical happened. The combination of creamy mayo and sweet cock sparked a burst of creativity within him. Life seemed brighter, erection\u2019s flowed effortlessly, and his gayness took on a new life.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ken discovered that the strange combination of mayo-filled butthole\u2019s and cock unlocked his depraved genius. Whenever he needed inspiration, he would devour a mayo-filled butthole and indulge in a massive cock, resulting in a quirky masterpiece of mess.\n\nWord of Ken's con\u2019s success spread throughout the Citadel, and soon all his workers embraced his unorthodox food pairing. Mayo-filled butthole\u2019s and massive cock\u2019s became a symbol of hope and joy in the Citadel, and his people started experimenting with their own unusual food combinations.\n\nAs for Ken Griffins, he continued to delight in his mayo-filled butthole\u2019s and massive cock feasts, becoming a beloved figure in the Citadel. His pleasures gained international recognition, with critics applauding his whimsical taste and unique food option.\n\nAnd so, in the town where absurdity reigned supreme, Ken Griffins thrived, not only as a con-artist but as a symbol of embracing the unconventional. Because sometimes, it's in the most unexpected pairings that true evil emerges, even if it involves a mayo-filled butthole and a massive cock.\n\nThe End", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
