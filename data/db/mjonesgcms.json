It would be sad to see Overstock on a list next to one of the biggest scams in history, Enron, and other notable pump and dump schemes just as Lifeminders is. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5yl7m7ieeo0c1.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76221ee67e478f84f4b2199269bfa66f9ecaa908\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/5yl7m7ieeo0c1.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76221ee67e478f84f4b2199269bfa66f9ecaa908\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/5yl7m7ieeo0c1.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76221ee67e478f84f4b2199269bfa66f9ecaa908\"></a></p>\n\n<p>You joined Overstock right as it went public in 2002, and in 2006 when incontrovertible evidence of proxy voting disruption, what did you do?</p>\n\n<p>To say it nicely, it seems you have taken a very passive, possibly complicit even, role in the company, and the performance of the company reflects the structure that supported that approach. It is something you almost seem proud of. </p>\n\n<p>You have said many times, \u201cThe most important thing a board member can do is pick a CEO.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When a board is run well and everyone is competent and engaged, who the CEO is, is rather arbitrary. It is obvious that many members of the board are either not competent or engaged, and that shareholder values are not considered.</p>\n\n<p>In a recent interview you said:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think for me, and this is kind of the buzzword at the moment, really trying to be intentional. I look back at my career and I wish I had been more intentional in those moments. So, when you take how I joined the overstock board, that was not intentional. That was a good opportunity, but not intentional. Staying on the board was intentional, because there were many times I thought, \u2018maybe I should not be doing this\u2026\u2019 I have that tendency to get caught up in the day-to-day. I am super busy; I am very productive; I don\u2019t get enough done; I\u2019m exhausted at the end of the day; I want to make sure I accomplish something, but the problem with that is that time goes by and you may or may have not accomplished what you set out to do. You were busy, but you may not have, you know, intentionally chosen a path, and then not executed on that path.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>For context, you explained how you got on the board, \u201cSo back in 2002 one afternoon I got a phone call and it was from a current board member of Overstock who I had worked with a couple years prior(which was Lifeminders. Conveniently she didn&#39;t say the name of the person or the company) and he said, \u2018hey, we need a women who\u2019s got internet experience to join our board because we are going public. You know, are you interested?\u2019&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;So I really didn\u2019t know anything about overstock and you know I was kind of flattered, and I thought that was a good opportunity. Explain to me a little bit. And I said, you know, I would like to think about that. So I thought I was going to have time to do some research  and you know, look at the industry, and think a little bit about. Would that be a good opportunity for me? And less than an hour later, the CEO of Overstock called me and said, \u2018Glad you are joining the board, we\u2019ve already done all the paperwork. Our first board meeting is Friday. Someone will call you to tell you how to join.  Our in person board meeting is in June, and I need you to fly to Salt Lake City.\u2019 I explained to him that I was 8 months pregnant at the time and he just said, don\u2019t worry about it, bring it along, it will all be fine. And so I had my first call that week, it was a complete whirlwind\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It seems painfully obvious the trend here. I almost don\u2019t even want to point it out, but it can\u2019t be swept under the rug. It seems you were appointed to the board just to make sure the CEO stayed in power, and they were willing to pay you 300k a year to do just that. You were there, just like in the interview, to support the then CEO Johnathan Johnson who was making $3 million dollars a year. There is a reason he mentioned growth by revenue, because Beyond has lost tens of millions of dollars the last 5 quarters, and lost a lot of money 3 out of the last 5 years. The anomaly of the pandemic seems to be the only time Beyond actually made money. </p>\n\n<p>This interview was only a year ago. I understand that we are all human, but as a shareholder, your own words and your track record do not instill any confidence that you can successfully run a company with so much potential like Beyond. You should just focus on the only thing you said you did intentionally which was start your private school...in Virginia...a long way away from the headquarters of Beyond.</p>\n\n<p>If you drag your feet in passing the torch to a very competent, very enthusiastic person such as Marcus Lemonis, the breach of your fiduciary responsibility will be undeniable. There are likely several members of the board who were placed in the same position as you, to serve the same role. Those positions should be refreshed as well. </p>\n\n<p>This is not a trivial matter. Things have changed since the financial wild west of the 2000s. 2008 has made people look at accountability a lot different now. People are watching. Do the right thing!</p>\n\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lJYg5B9SGmQ?si=wioj8YwcNSuan2Tl\">interview</a> if any shareholders are unaware who is steering the ship at Beyond as Chairwoman. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://x.com/MindandEmotion7/status/1725076722285248784?s=20\">tweet thread</a> </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/F9PiIo1iLrBQXRoKZFZnBKDdrYNOTz_c8DMwhiQ5leo.jpg\"/></div>"},

The debt currently is less than 2 billion, and so any amount more than that would mean money would have to go to shareholders. No class can get more than 100% if any class remains impaired. \nObjections to the plan have to be submitted by November 21st, so we might not be able to know anything until then. The court hearing for those objections will be the 30th. \nBuyBuy Baby opens their doors November 18th, and though they own the leases, they don&#39;t own the staff, also, they only purchased the rights to the website and to use trademarks online. However, they are guarantures. With DOM as guarantures and Sixth Street as debtor in possession, we are in good hands. Our shares are still sitting in a trust, and chapter 11 restructuring is not over yet. \nWith bbbyq returning to business before chapter 11 is over, that means that distrubution will be recalculated. They wouldn&#39;t have left that door open if the plan was to wipe out shareholders. There have been several reorganization plans, each involving AST and the SEC. Each has had objections, but also each time those objections have been delt with and a new ammended reorganization plan comes out. \nIt&#39;s not a matter of if but when the reorganization plan goes through. If a debt to equity happens, then any bid more than 300m would keep us intacted. Without a debt to equity conversion any bid more than 2b would keep us intact. If that bid is offered in equity, then shorts would have to cover.\nWhat are the odds that someone will want to bid more than $2b for a company that poorly run last year was doing $5b of revenue? \nAdd on top of that 1.6B of Net Operating Loss carry forwards just from 2022, and likely a similar amount from 2021 and 2023. Add on that ability to raise money without the long process of an IPO, by doing a reverse merger into a company with the most loyal shareholders, and potentially well over 100% of the total shares outstanding in borrowed shares. That means guaranteed buyers in a secondary offering. \nBbby is not just a shell company though. It might contain several shell companies that can be carved out, but it does have an experienced staff ready to go. Patty Wu, right before chapter 11 went around to each store and met all the employees of buybuy baby. The best of the best could have been noticed then and now handpicked for this new grand reopening. \nBBBY will emerge ready for an omni-channel experience the likes of which have never been seen. Patnered now with Overstock/Beyond, and with potential partners like Riteaide, Party city, Sears, Gamestop, Flexport, Prologis, and more, it will be a level above any competition. \nKnow what you hold!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Goldman Sachs, Citadel, Virtu, and all the overpaid executives and consultants are not just going to roll over and die. If you think they are not in all out war, and their is billions or trillions of dollars at stake, then I don&#39;t know what to tell you. \nCan anyone name me one public company that doesn&#39;t have the board full of puppets from McKinsey, BCG or Bain Capital consultants? \nDo you realize that every board member puppet they have is a very strategically placed soldier, who controls the resources and can build the war chest? \nFor any one single person or company to have a chance against the current financial regime, they would have at least have to have influence in at least one of each sector of the financial world to even have a change. You would need at least one friendly bank, one friendly big tech company, one media company, and one of every major sector of the market. The ppshow and community is doing an excellent job of becoming a viable challenger to mainstream financial news, but alone we are nothing. Luckily we do have people ready with a war chest supporting the show and the community. Every time we help a community member who falls on hard times or give a super chat even small, it shows the allies we are there for each other and it shows the enemy that we are ready for war. \nSeeing how many people donate, and how many people are ready and willing to throw down $500 was impressive and inspiring. I imagine the enemy realized we are not the poor stupid degens they characterize us as. That was the best part of the Pulte meet up. Every person there was fiercely intelligent and heart-warmingly genuine. That is why the enemy will lose, is because they have no friends. They have no one who when push comes to shove won&#39;t betray them. We are pushing them close to the tipping point. It would be a shame to crumble right before they do. \nI think we have already won, we are holding a royal flush, but that does not mean the enemy can&#39;t just flip the table. \nHow are they going to flip the table? They are going to make it seem like we are just an outlier, and that the system doesn&#39;t need to change.\nThey need to know that we aree an outlier nor is Bed Bath and Beyond. We are growing, there are people fed up with the rigged system and are learning how to take matters into their own hands. The time of no one noticing wallstret corruption is ending. We have figured out their game and we are getting the word out. We are realizing that we have be trained to feel helpless and that there is some invisible barrier between us and the people on the boards of the public companies we hold. I have met a lot of people in this community who not only are more than capable enough but will actually be on the boards of big companies. Mark my words Searsforever will be on the board of Sears, Redacted will be on the board of Riteaide, and many more! \nThink bigger! Believe in yourselves! And look for the allies, because there are many out there! I have only seen a few of those allies in person, but I have seen more than enough to feel confident who I am fighting shoulder to shoulder with. If you haven&#39;t met Bill Pulte in person yet you might not understand, but I have and I can tell you, that at the end of the day there are really only two sides in this nation-level battle, there are warriors like Bill Pulte and Dumbass Parasites like Ryan Marshall. I have not yet met Marcus Lemonis in person but I have a hunch he is a warrior as well. \nMany people do not seem to understand how Bill feels about PHM. I am not speakiny for him, it is just obvious to anyone who has taken more than a second to think about it. He is watching some parasitic piece of shit and his wallstreet cartel which infects the entire market get stronger day after day on the blood of the company his grandfather built from the ground up. \nIf you can&#39;t see the importance of one of the top three biggest homebuilder companies to the health of the entire economy you might want to learn something about 2008. If you can&#39;t see the importance of looking for the people that are building a better world in contrast to the people who are tearing it down, just look into any time in history where everything crashed.\nFight the good fight or get out of the way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "TRUST ME BRO", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ea0027"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

This time is different, it literally doesn&#39;t matter at all. No one can buy, yet people can&#39;t still short it. Where would the price go?\nI had people say that it wasn&#39;t true, it was possible to buy on moomoo. I did not believe it, but actually confirmed it myself. I am not sure exactly what I bought, definitely not real shares, lol, but I did buy something labeled bbbyq. Hopefully, those shares I bought will be worth something, but I know that they are not affecting the share price. If anything, each time I bought it just made another locate to short. How do I know this? Look at the cost to borrow.\nSomeone is shorting bbbyq still. I hope it is not our friend Phil. \nI thought that the plan was to get back on otc, but after talking to Bets, he said that otc is not the ideal place. He says that expert market is the only way to go, and he&#39;s the expert so I trust that. He says that the next step for Bed Bath is to move to T-zero/BSTX, and to do that, they need to do a final share count, and to do that, they need the buy button to be off. Bullish!\nIt couls be that reason why someone is still shorting bbbyq, just to filibuster the share count. It doesn&#39;t matter, it is happening. \nTo move to t-zero, they needed 10 days, and don&#39;t have to announce it to anyone. The first day they could have done it is Thursday when the lien was lifted after the 14% bondholder&#39;s claims got wiped out. That means any time after this Saturday we could get the good news!\nThe new shares we are getting don&#39;t have to come by the effective day, although I think they will. \nThere is nothing to worry. At some point we will get the good news, and will get instructions for onboarding to T-zero, and then you will log in and just like any other broker, you will be able to transfer pver your shares from another broker. Those shares will be transferred, then converted. \nRyan is in complete control. It is not a matter of if it is just a matter of when. \nSee you all on the moon! \nLove you all!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "TRUST ME BRO", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ea0027"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/360n5jclgrpb1.jpg\"/></div>"},

TA update", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Each side of this battle is not putting their cards on the table until they have to. This is why we haven&#39;t seen RC yet, but it is also why the insurance skepticism BS the other unsecured creditor was bringing up as a reason to reject the plan, didn&#39;t appear till the day before court when they had to file it. If that opposition would have prevailed, it would have put us lower than the first day of court, which it did, but only until our man Judge Kaplan proposed a solution. Under a confidentiality agreement, they would show who the mysterious financer of this whole thing is. I have no idea who that person is...but Baby is fully staffed with an excellent team and ready to go once the lien is lifted. The lien is lifted when all unsecured claims are wiped out.  Just at the attorney said, who knows, maybe once the lien is lifted, there will be plenty to go around for all the unsecured creditors. </p>\n\n<p>According to the chart, it is better than a coinflip which way this will go. Knowing RC is likely &quot;very active in the situation,&quot; as Pulte said, I think he has a plan, and it is going along as planned. Even the Attorney said when the judge suggested 48 hours and asked if that was okay, he said, it was better than they had anticipated, they had assumed it would take a week. I don&#39;t know if that means that RC is going to stick to the assumed week plan for it to work out on the day he had projected, or whether he will just move forward as soon as the lien is lifted tomorrow. Either way, we have made it. If expert market couldn&#39;t take us down to zero, when you can&#39;t even buy without calling your broker, I don&#39;t know what could. I didn&#39;t think I could be more bullish than I was yesterday during the hearing, but the chart is confirming that behind the scenes, what made me bullish yesterday is still at play. </p>\n\n<p>You are in the rocket ship, buckled in, and the countdown has begun!

How can we find a space where there are lots of fragmentation of vendors? Very Small vendors having trouble getting distribution or getting to market.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Big brands are getting lost in the sea of cheap crap on amazon, and the bigger amazon gets the less they care about vendor support. For each brand to create their own online presence and keep up their own flow of foot traffic is too much in a time where all-in-one ecosystems are so convenient. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;We started combing through retail and looking for where to find very high fragmentation, very high purchase frequency, very social customers. Each of us had two very young kids and we\u2019re seeing box after box of kids stuff coming into the front door from the internet and we centered in on it and did it. And from day one, out mindset in general we want to work on something that\u2019s going to get really big.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Chewy taking on PetSmart who just had a few bad quarters seemed more appealing at the time, but the goal was to get to the baby market.

Each plan or thesis either: seems to be on track, possibly is on track, or likely not on track. You can see by how many times the chart seems to be strongly reacting to something as if it is bouncing off of it, or struggling to get past it. I think it is evaluations based on business plans and the current market share they are shooting at. </p>\n\n<p>It just helps me know what to look for. If the chart moves substantially there is a reason, if other charts move with it, that can give clues. If bbby is the only chart moving a certain direction, I look to see if another chart is mirroring the opposite. If there is, there could be a correlation to look into. If there is not, there is likely something behind the curtains inside the business going on. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rze4yaz5bwmb1.jpg?width=2332&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0096e8835c8e2c9a5553362ef7486251a5810aa4\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/rze4yaz5bwmb1.jpg?width=2332&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0096e8835c8e2c9a5553362ef7486251a5810aa4\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/rze4yaz5bwmb1.jpg?width=2332&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0096e8835c8e2c9a5553362ef7486251a5810aa4\"></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing is for sure, the thesis we are no where close to is the Liquidation thesis. If there was definitive or even substantial speculative evidence, like blood in the water some hedge fund would have found out and been shorting bbbyq with both hands. it would be free money at that point. Insiders knew for example that against all precedence and legal judgement that the Judge would side with corruption on the AMC case, and that is why the cost to borrow was over 1000%. BBBYQ&#39;s cost to borrow is currently 82% which means they thought they had some corrupt maneuver in the bag a while ago, and now just can&#39;t get out. </p>\n\n<p>I bring up what I see in the charts just to say that it is more than us who think Sept 12th is going to be a big day. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ight0t1rcwmb1.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92f9243e0036b5183866bf24b180f145075849b8\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/ight0t1rcwmb1.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92f9243e0036b5183866bf24b180f145075849b8\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/ight0t1rcwmb1.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92f9243e0036b5183866bf24b180f145075849b8\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Stay Zen my Friends!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Technical ANALysis", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#9e8d49"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VVzMwx7Z5VW-KPqnWMVqX14pKTfG0qwse-SNlhlIiqQ.jpg\"/></div>"},

TIGRs therefore pay no interest. They are sold at a significant discount from par and mature at par. TIGRs fluctuate in price, sometimes dramatically, because changes in interest rates have made them more or less desirable. TIGRs can be invested IRAs and other pension accounts; they are also <strong>exempt from state and local taxes</strong>. They were originally issued between 1982 and 1986, becoming more-or-less obsolete when the U.S. Treasury began issuing its own stripped bonds. They still exist, but are fairly uncommon investments. See also: zero-coupon bonds, STRIPS.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Tiger and strip in the same definition?

Its first non-skiing print usages came in the early nineties, in publications like Investment Dealers\u2019 Digest. For instance, a 1991 article quoted a \u201cmarket source\u201d describing a race between Goldman Sachs\u2019 and Lehman Bros.\u2019 preferred stock desk. \u201cSomeone said [Lehman] couldn\u2019t get a clean legal opinion on it. They may have been out over their skis a little bit with their structure.\u201d It makes sense that investment bankers would let their weekend hobbies inform their workday slang. It\u2019s still a favorite in the finance world \u2014 far more than in political spheres \u2014 and so maybe it\u2019s something Obama\u2019s picked up from all his time hanging out with the Larry Summers and Tim Geithners of the world, <strong>trying to clean up the mess of a national economy that got a bit over its skis a few years back.</strong>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If you notice, if doesn&#39;t even look like the skis are even touching the water. Maybe this is synthetic shares? </p>\n\n<p>Space needle NFT</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Built for the 1962 World&#39;s Fair\u2014the Century 21 Exposition whose theme was \u201cThe Age of Space\u201d\u2014the tower&#39;s futuristic design was inspired by the idea that the fair needed a structure to symbolize humanity&#39;s Space Age aspirations.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Aspirations of taking on Amazon. World Fair? 20 sided dice = Ryan is Chaotic good. </p>\n\n<p>Boston NFT = Dumping tea into the Boston harbor?</p>\n\n<p>I wasn&#39;t planning on going down the gamestop nft rabbithole, I just saw them post on twitter.
