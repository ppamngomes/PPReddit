My name is [REDACTED]. One moment while I review your request.</p>\n\n<p>( 5m 26s ) [REDACTED]: Hey [REDACTED], hope you are well</p>\n\n<p>( 7m 33s ) [REDACTED]: Thank you for chatting in today. I am happy to assist you.</p>\n\n<p>( 7m 52s ) [REDACTED]: I can see that you have questions about direct registration. How can I help?</p>\n\n<p>( 8m 9s ) [REDACTED]: I would like to direct register my BBBYQ shares</p>\n\n<p>( 8m 32s ) [REDACTED]: Okay. Let me look into this. Please give me 3-5 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>( 9m 12s ) [REDACTED]: If you could help me that would be great. I&#39;ve been trying to do this for over two weeks now. I&#39;ve already filed a complaint with FINRA</p>\n\n<p>( 12m 47s ) [REDACTED]: Thank you for your patience. I have found that when a company declares bankruptcy we are unable to transfer shares so we would be unable to process that request.</p>\n\n<p>( 13m 28s ) [REDACTED]: Can you explain to me then how other retail investors are able to direct register?</p>\n\n<p>( 13m 48s ) [REDACTED]: Frankly, I think this is an excuse</p>\n\n<p>( 14m 21s ) [REDACTED]: I cannot explain the actions of firms. All that I can advise is that we are unable to process that request.</p>\n\n<p>( 14m 48s ) [REDACTED]: Furthermore, they are under corporate reorganization... can you explain to me in terms of market mechanics why you are unable to fulfill my request today?</p>\n\n<p>( 15m 21s ) [REDACTED]: They still have a transfer agent... you have a system for digital registration. What am I missing here?</p>\n\n<p>( 15m 56s ) [REDACTED]: No, I am unable to explain that. All that I can advise is that we are unable to process that request due to the bankruptcy.</p>\n\n<p>( 16m 30s ) [REDACTED]: I would like to speak with your compliance officer please</p>\n\n<p>( 17m 15s ) [REDACTED]: Our compliance officer does not have a direct line, though this chat will be saved as a formal complaint and sent to them.</p>\n\n<p>( 18m 4s ) [REDACTED]: I&#39;m sorry but its unacceptable as a licensed broker for you to deny my request, despite the fact that it is my right as a retail investor via FINRA 11870, and you can not give me an explanation or justification in terms of market mechanics... can you not locate shares to register in my name?</p>\n\n<p>( 19m 41s ) [REDACTED]: Furthermore, your original answer is false. I have personally been able to direct register shares previously during the chapter 11 reorganization. Do you lie to all retail investors like this?</p>\n\n<p>( 20m 25s ) [REDACTED]: So you are denying my rights as a retail investor, lying to me, and then refusing to elaborate? Do you think this is okay?</p>\n\n<p>( 21m 46s ) [REDACTED]: Please understand I have no ill will towards you as an individual. I understand you are doing your job. The actions of your company are deplorable.</p>\n\n<p>( 22m 21s ) [REDACTED]: Can you please escalate my request? I would like to speak with someone who can elucidate the nature of your refusal to process my transfer today</p>\n\n<p>( 24m 35s ) [REDACTED]: I can attempt to submit a new direct registration request. I advised what I did because I have seen the previous request rejected for the purpose explained before. I cannot guarantee that the new request will be successful. If it is not successful then you can request a physical certificate of the shares and then send it to the transfer agent.</p>\n\n<p>( 25m 3s ) [REDACTED]: Are you unable to process the direct registration digitally?</p>\n\n<p>( 26m 56s ) [REDACTED]: I can submit it. I am in the process of submitting it for you now. That is what you would like, correct?</p>\n\n<p>( 27m 9s ) [REDACTED]: Yes please, that would be great</p>\n\n<p>( 28m 56s ) [REDACTED]: Thank you very much for your help today. I hate to cause trouble for you, but it is necessary for me to advocate for myself and the actions of your company are against federal regulations... this is not okay.</p>\n\n<p>( 29m 8s ) [REDACTED]: Thank you. To confirm, you are wanting to direct register to yourself 17150 of cusip XXX-XX-6100, correct?</p>\n\n<p>( 29m 37s ) [REDACTED]: Yes please</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff4500"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
