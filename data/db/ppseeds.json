I want to make this post to further give my thoughts on this crazy week. First we had the mega shill space which I really enjoyed because it gave us a middle ground to try and debate. Do I think we should continue doing this? No I don\u2019t. I think we gave enough information about our thesis and if someone truly wants to debate further they are always welcome on the show. I\u2019ve noticed an increase of drama on the sub primarily leaking over from Twitter. I think we should all try to refrain from engaging in any active drama as I believe it\u2019s a way to drag our community through the mud. </p>\n\n<p>I think a lot of people in this community and the former bbby community have done the due diligence and I think it isn\u2019t fair to them when they post actual dd and it\u2019s smothered and lost with Twitter drama. I understand that I maybe have contributed to it as well by posting dougie tweets etc. but I guess my main point with those tweets was to show a market maker losing his mind on bbbyq. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways I think this is a really great community and when I read a post today from badasstrader accusing our people of releasing his information I was appalled. This is so far from the truth and to be honest I will be seeking legal action for slander at a later time. I had nothing to do with anyone information being released neither did this community. Even my own name was released at some point. Travis personal information was also released Thursday and another very big prominent member from here information was also released this week. Our own members from bbbyq are having their information released and yet they want to point the finger at us. Ridiculous and childish. </p>\n\n<p>So to sum this up, the reason ThePPShow Reddit and also show is so popular is because we are so positive. We believe in what we talk about and we more importantly believe in RC. Let them make up their lies about us, let them attack us, let them slander us. The only thing they can\u2019t do is stop us because we change things. We push the human race forward. \u201cAnd those who are crazy enough to believe they can change the world are the ones who do.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We.arent.fucking.leaving.

To be fair Bill, RC, and Icahn all live pretty close to each other. I know the theory has always been Brett Icahn took this photo but have we ever thought that bill is the one who did?

Looking forward to seeing you on the show tonight just wanted to have a conversation as I notice a few comments throughout the sub so let\u2019s address the pulte meet up in NYC. Please feel free to comment your thoughts as it\u2019s good to conversant.  </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s essentially a Pultegroup shareholder meet up which is fine considering it was a last minute type of meet up. First I think bill is just in NYC and wanted to have fun so he did a pop up meet up to get together with some like minded people and have a beer. Nothing wrong in my opinion with that. I think some people were a bit upset it wasn\u2019t about bbby but why would it be about bbby to begin with? The Florida meet up is a live ppshow bbbyq event with the addition of hanging out with the crew and also bill pulte. Very different in my honest opinion compared to this. </p>\n\n<p>I really don\u2019t think anyone should be upset over this NYC thing being for pulte shareholders because again it seems to me like it was just a more last minute let\u2019s get together type of thing. And bill is involved with pulte group so why wouldn\u2019t he want to label that meet up as so? I also want to highlight a few things with bill pulte and have you understand why a lot of people like me are bullish on him. </p>\n\n<p>RC interacts primarily with bills tweets, he\u2019s liked many of his tweets which to me seems like there is something here. </p>\n\n<p>He came into this sub when we had less than 2k users here. I believe bill has validated our Sub and also show on being correct on the thesis that RC is very much involved in bbby and baby. There is really no other explanation that can be made here. Bill started off by commenting In beyond Uranus many months ago before he ended up here. Beyond Uranus is a hardcore tinfoil sub, like you think we like tinfoil here? You guys need to meet the Uranus boys. They are next level type of tin. Anyways after he interacts with beyond Uranus he ends up in meltdown where he talks shit and trolls them until his ban. After that he ends up here in the ppsub. Remember during all this time he has always had the backing of SS where he even did an AMA there with a lot of support. </p>\n\n<p>So if this truly was a \u201cgrift\u201d why not use SS with over 800k people? You see it\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t make sense to anyone. The difference between our sub here is we believe the ground thesis is Ryan cohen is involved in bbby and baby. That is why he is here in this sub, that is why he backs the show. That is why we are meeting him for a live show with 100 other people in Florida. </p>\n\n<p>If you want my honest opinion I think RC sent him here or gave him the ok to interact with us as much as he has. I understand everyone is of course entitled to how they feel but let\u2019s have some conversations and actually think hard about why bill is here so often and willing to put his name on the line for this sub and the show. Love you guys see you tonight. And for those meeting bill today have a great time!! Buy him a beer from PP and get to know how genuine he is.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Hey pp gals! Hope you all had a great weekend!! I wanted to provide my own thoughts on some of the information provided over the weekend. First with the post regarding the $12.77 and 10B claim. I think there could potentially be something here. I know some have said it\u2019s price anchoring which it somewhat is, but I\u2019d like to approach this as a possibility of what\u2019s to come. Here at ThePPShow we don\u2019t care what people do with their money so if people sell at those levels it is what it is. </p>\n\n<p>Non of us should ever try to convince anyone what to do with their investment. Do I think the stock could potentially climb higher than that? Absolutely. The reason is heavily because of tinfoil. First bill saying to tip $500, then RC raising that to 1k off his most recent tweet to the rangers. \nI believe the $12 is a good indicator of a deal coming in soon. I remain hopeful and also bullish on RC and other people potentially involved in this stock. </p>\n\n<p>The second thing I want to cover is when we potentially could see a deal go down, now we all know dates are just a bunch of hype shit by now, but I have a feeling the Nov 20 exclusivity has something to do with this. I believe if we do see something it will either be sometime before this date or perhaps after it. It\u2019s interesting that buy buy baby is relaunching a lot of their new stuff by Nov 18th. 2 days before exclusivity ends. Personally I think it will be before the 20th and I  think we will see a carve out of baby and perhaps we keep the current ticker. Those are my thoughts over the weekend. See you guys Monday!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Love you guys wanted to make a post here to explain some of my thoughts. Based on some of these dockets coming out it appears we are towards the finish line. I believe we are witnessing the preservation of nols and the tinfoil is slowly becoming true. Carrington had written up something interesting with the 10B dollar claim and the previous 1B dollar claim being for 10% bid on the company. Could very well be likely that we possibly see a credit bid next or a swap of debt for equity. The key here for shareholders to be made whole is to have enough excess money within the company itself. First shills said we all were wasting our time looking at nols, now they are changing their tune to creditors owning 50% of the company will still wipe us out. </p>\n\n<p>I think our time has come, we are all ready to go to zero or hero but the thing I find interesting is a lot of these shills expect us to just leave even if we lose. What these shills don\u2019t realize that even if we win or lose we aren\u2019t going anywhere. Retail now has the power back via ThePPShow. Our sub is getting over 22m views a month. We average about 1m views per day here at ThePPShow subreddit. THIS is the power of retail. Win or lose we ain\u2019t going fucking anywhere and all of this bullshit inside this fraudulent market will be exposed and brought into the light. Keep fighting fellas and don\u2019t ever forget what we\u2019ve started here.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

What separates our sub from many others is our moderation and also our free thought of opinions. </p>\n\n<p>We enjoy talking about BBBY here primarily due to Ryan cohens involvement and still his current involvement in the company today.

Things have not been smooth sailing for a lot of us these last months but I\u2019m glad to be the one to allow everyone to come together here and formulate constructive thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>I started with meme videos and a lot of people liked them early on in the OG bbby sub. I really enjoyed making them because they were FOR the community. Everything I have done has always been for the community. Creating this show and this sub I never imagined it would grow as fast and as large as it has. A lot of you have great ideas, a lot of you are hilarious, and a lot of you have fucking guts. You are the people who make the world go round. Truly. I just want to give my thanks to this growing community and all the PPs out there. I appreciate that a lot of you support the show and want to see it continue, I\u2019m happy to hear that because that is my plan after this. </p>\n\n<p>I think we have some of the smartest people in this community and to see where this goes next will be incredible. I don\u2019t think BBBYs story has ended either and I think personally this is just beginning. I choose to believe in the tinfoil because there are too many connections to think otherwise. Some may think we are crazy, I see genius. I believe whatever we have created here is extremely powerful, something that ultimately cannot be stopped. Our subs are attacked on a daily basis, our character is attacked on a daily basis, and yet we still push forward. We push forward for a dream only we can see. Do I think we\u2019re all nuts? Absolutely. Do I think we\u2019re wrong? No I honestly don\u2019t. </p>\n\n<p>If we were so crazy we wouldn\u2019t have so much attention on us all the time. </p>\n\n<p>So my only words to you all is: I believe. I believe we\u2019ve all been brought here for a reason. Win or lose. Hero or zero. Whatever the fuck it may be let\u2019s fuck around and find out and more importantly let\u2019s have some fun while doing so. I love you all.

I\u2019m not going to lie a lot of the posts from last night were highly suspicious when analyzing and looking through post history. I understand fully of allowing both sides of discussion and some were either happy or unhappy with the show. You are entitled to fully feel the way you want and I understand that. But we 100% had bots attacking the sub and a bunch of random accounts I have never seen before in my life pop up. We also were brigaded from alot of SS accounts and also meltdown accounts with 0 history of ever posting in the pp sub. </p>\n\n<p>Here is my take, we discuss tinfoil at great lengths so what has changed? Absolutely fucking nothing. I find it very interesting the ice cream at 1 hour and 47 minutes into the show. I have a feeling this is symbolic to us winning. Again I ATE OUT THE SAME TUB OF ICE CREAM AS BILL. Does nobody else find this symbolic as fucking shit? Another thing is the show ended at roughly 7:14PM which was Yom Kippur ending as well. This entire play is fucking tinfoil but either a lot of people have overnight forgot that or there is a slew of bad actors who certainly tried to come and paint a certain picture of bill. This man is highly intelligent and is not a fool. Don\u2019t let people gas light you into thinking otherwise. There is a reason RC openly interacts with his tweets. I am fully in the dark in all of this like many of you. I\u2019m here to put on a good show and I believe whatever last night was donations was something strategic occurring. Again where are all my tinfoil guys at?? Fucking ice cream seriously at 1:47??? Yeah you can\u2019t convince me otherwise anymore that this may actually go down. Bill is fully aware of our situation with bbby and the risk of being cancelled, people need to trust in whatever process is happening behind the scenes. If you don\u2019t believe there is anything left why are you here? Nobody is stopping you from selling your investment and moving on. Do whatever you want with your money. But I\u2019m willing to hold this shit to 0 or moon. </p>\n\n<p>I appreciate bill for giving me not only an opportunity to film in his office but also represent all the PPs out there that he is obviously putting into the spotlight of this play. I was a bit upset reading alot of the hate from some of these accounts over donations. I have never asked anyone for a single penny. I believe there is a reason for everything. Including bill telling people to donate $500 to meet him. I believe in tinfoil. Do whatever the fuck you want believe whatever the fuck you want. Something is off about everything with this play. </p>\n\n<p>Love you guys please don\u2019t fight amongst eachother look back at the symbolism of the stream. This was clearly a celebration soon to come.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

So with that being said look how far we\u2019ve got in 9 months my PPs. 9 months ago there was 50 people in this sub that\u2019s now grown to 12,000. 9 months ago I was streaming to 20 people and now it\u2019s over 1k average. If we were simply wrong we wouldn\u2019t be so successful on our journey. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously flying out to interview bill in person is a huge deal and accomplishment not only for me but all of you as well. So I give you all a big thank you to every supporter and every PP out there. You know I\u2019ll represent the PPs with absolute class. Love you all thank you for your support over the last 9 months.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I mean we have to ask ourselves what does bill pulte really see in PP? The thing is I run a show we talk about bbby and allow people to come on and share opinions. It seems to me he has taken a liking to this community including myself and a few other notable people you know. I understand bill is a fan totally 100% agreed. But flying out to his offices to conduct an in person show has got me thinking. Why? Bill could simply interact more and come onto the show any time but he wants us there in person. Do you really think something major could be announced via ThePPShow? Again I would really love some more in depth opinions because it can\u2019t just be he is a huge fan and wants us to fly in to do the show? There\u2019s got to be something else here and I can\u2019t be the only one who thinks so.

The climax of the sketch always occurred when he would perform an act involving explosives which would inevitably destroy the set, typically sending people running for their lives as he said another catchphrase, some variation of, \"'Don't worry, folks. I am a fire marshal!'\" before the expected destruction.\n\nAlthough almost every sketch sees him maimed or otherwise seriously injured (in more than one sketch, only his head was left), Bill never died and always appeared among those forced out of the destroyed structure. His immortality also lends itself to long life as he apparently performed the same standard of service as a fire marshall on the Titanic as, in his own words, \"'Unsinkable' my good eye!\"\n\nBill has a wife named Ashley who appears in the third sketch where the couple is on a cruise vacation.

The fact that he discredited that even when I said they did 1.2B last quarter should tell you enough. He sounds like those people who would say people don\u2019t shop at GameStop back in 2020.

Christine Wilson (who resigned from the FTC on 2/14 complaining of regulatory overreach) was nominated by Trump very likely at Icahn's urging. She was a partner at K&A for years and worked on multiple Icahn-adjacent acquisitions. One of the \"Icahn Designees\" on the Newell board who's been a portfolio manager and managing director w/ Icahn for years is also a board member of Trump Entertainment Resorts. On 2/8 his title as \"Icahn Designee\" was removed at Newell (though he stayed on the board) and the chair also stepped down (though he too remains on the board)\n3. political: the current FTC is grandstanding for political points specifically for the past couple of years over private equity deals of this kind\nspecifically, the rushed newell board changes on 2/8 (which were made by icahn waiving the 35-day notice period because they were in a hurry) start looking like concessions to the FTC in order to grant consent\nbeyond this, newell's restructuring into three specific business units (which were referenced in their Q4 call a couple weeks ago) look like what you do if you're about to have to divest certain business lines and/or merge them with outside entities.\nthe FTC has in the past couple of years gotten very aggressive about \"interlocking directorates\" being violations of the Clayton act\nthey're blocking deals simply on the basis of an acquirer having board members on related companies (because they could theoretically collude to harm competition)\ngiven the precedent this FTC has set, simply by virtue of e.g. Icahn controlling basically the entire board at newell the FTC could balk at the prospect of Icahn also controlling bbby\nin any case, my expectation is that the deal has been tied up in HSR limbo for a while now and I'm personally looking for the FTC to consent (if they haven't already) sometime between 3/11 and 3/20\nnewell filings, Icanh filings and BBBY filings do conjure a solid thesis to the above", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Please understand this is for the better, again I like Kais I see him as a good dude but I think some of this stuff lately is a bit too much for me. I\u2019ve had friends commit suicide over the years and I know the pain it brings not only family but loved ones and friends.

I miss the old Kais the one who would just go to warehouses for dd, or interviewing nice people at bbby stores.

I will be bringing on my good friend runningwithbearz as we dissect the financials of BBBY earnings after Tuesday to get a better understanding of where the company sits. \n\nLinks will be provided on the stream later this week so you can subscribe:\n\nOn ThePPShow we want everyone to have a chance to come on and talk about their favorite stock. Towards the end if you want to come on and talk your more than welcome to! It\u2019s super easy to join in without a cam and just use voice chat if you want as well. \n\nIf you have any specific questions for bearz please reply in this post so I can gather them for our guest. I\u2019m sure some of you have some questions so let me know. \n\nLooking forward to seeing you guys on Wednesday! Bring the brews. \n\nPp", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
