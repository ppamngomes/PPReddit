For instance, the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel has defined commercial information as information that would bestow *an unfair advantage to competitors by providing them information as to the commercial operations of the debtor.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In general, however, courts have applied \u00a7 107(b)(1) in situations where &quot;open inspection may be used as a vehicle for improper purposes.&quot; Thus, pursuant to $ 107(6)(1), courts have maintained the confidentiality of, among other things, a licensing agreement where disclosure would cause &quot;an unfair advantage to competitors by providing them information as to the commercial operation of the debtor.</p>\n\n<p>Further, in determining whether an\nagreement can be filed under seal, a court often will review whether the parties to the contract believed that the agreement was confidential.</p>\n\n<p>If the protection pursuant to \u00a7 107(b)(1) is requested by a party in interest, courts differ on the standard to be applied for overcoming the presumption of the public&#39;s right of access under \u00a7 107(a). According to some courts, if the information contained in the document falls within the scope of any of the specified categories in the statute, the court must apply the protections.</p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR/Emphasis on this part:  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</p>\n\n<p>\u201ccourts have maintained the confidentiality of, among other things, a licensing agreement where disclosure would cause &quot;an unfair advantage to competitors by providing them information as to the commercial operation of the debtor.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if we already have a licensing agreement like getting royalties with Overstock and DOM and that\u2019s why the IP was sold for so little\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Even if not, just the fact that NDAs are often upheld to protect companies in ch. 11 from their competitors finding out too much is very useful to know.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Pulte mentioned that he was up to big things, that he was invested in twitter/x also, and when he answered the only the young question, he said it\u2019s part Ryan cohen and part\u2026 trailed off and talked about how we\u2019re probably at an inflection point in financial markets and how he thinks Ryan cohen is the real deal, then suddenly starts talking about Elon musk and X.\n\nMy take is that only the young is these two guys, meme-lords who are very outspoken about hating short sellers, are both involved. They\u2019re young enough billionaires that they\u2019re not entrenched in the same bs as the old system. They\u2019re fighting against it for fairer markets.\n\nI know a lot of people have mixed opinions about Elon, but honestly I think it\u2019s coming from the same place of hate against RC. They know he\u2019s building something huge and they\u2019re trying to tear him/them down.\n\nIf RC wants to build an Amazon competitor and destroy shorts at the same time, why not team up with fellow short-hating billionaire? Oh this guy just happened to recently buy Twitter and then randomly rename it X? It sounds like a placeholder. \n\nWhat if this teddy conglomerate of zombie stocks and bbbyq also merges with X?\n\nWhat if Teddy not only became a competitor to Amazon, but also to Facebook, and to banks?\n\nI\u2019d say a little less likely than Teddy just swooping baby but just imagine, this could be even bigger than we think. \n\nLet\u2019s fucking go.", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
