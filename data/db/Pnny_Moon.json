I have a feeling besides the one in my pants that this is a rinse sale betwen two parties with part of the compensation of this sale being under the table elsewhere.\n\nThe median house price is $878 thousand in this area which shows 699 thousand could be a no quid pro trust me bro price to keep housing prices aloft to delay forecloseures. Foreclosures kill in the Canadian cold combined with rain in raincouver. Don&#39;t like rain? Don&#39;t ever leave the house in Vancouver. Especially ones that occur at 2:36am and list in the same hour.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is this a beehive? NO? its just all the homes on sale in the heart of Gastown?

Meaning all home sales of 2022 are now taxable in the Canadian progressive tax system maximum of 1/3 of your income, roughly.
