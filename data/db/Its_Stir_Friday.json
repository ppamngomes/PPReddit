If I\u2019m understanding the bankruptcy process correctly bbbyq is not related at all to what Bed Bath & Beyond and BuyBuyBaby do on social media. \n\nI\u2019m constantly seeing posts about the old towel name brand on twitter and using rocket emojis. Overstock is only using the hype from their purchase to drive in more activity on social media. Nothing wrong with that and no tin foil here (unless RC plans to buy OSTK), especially when SEC said using emojis was market manipulation (joke of the SEC, i know). \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m just more amazed and dumbfounded people keep reposting the towel twitter and getting hyped over it. I don\u2019t post here much but this place seems much more positive than the main bbby sub. No discourse or FUD spreading I promise. I\u2019m just trying to remove the spread of misinformation from this sub! If this post breaks any rules I\u2019ll certainly remove it. \n\nHave a nice day all!", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
