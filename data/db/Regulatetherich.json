Imagine a decentralized platform to allow anyone with a cell phone to voice their choice towards changing the world. All verification is built in. No one can just lie or make up the books, deaths, or taxes. One world built for ALL not just the people who can afford the best lawyer or are good at covering up crimes like 2008! They have built a national emergency response fully tested recently on over 400 million phones recently. Information can be distributed to all with the majority able to comment and ensure it meets quality checks. Quality checks that provide equality and makes 2008 impossible without ALL voices in majority making it possible.

The people telling you that you don\u2019t deserve a vacation, or a gun are the ones sitting on a nuclear bomb switch. Did they ask you if our group savings(taxes) should be spent on killing other people(war) instead of building community infrastructure that is fully self sustaining for food, entertainment, socializing, and overall BETTERMENT of the planet and its EIGHT FUCKING BILLION YOUS.
