I write to you from my current infinity pool:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/abi6cy50se5b1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2625b4cd974b1af710d0138f7f67de1f92fdc73\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/abi6cy50se5b1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2625b4cd974b1af710d0138f7f67de1f92fdc73\" alt=\"Taking a bath at night is actually pretty awesome, although a small black bear seems to be eating my bar soap\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This is absolutely not financial advice as I literally live in a trailer in the woods and spent the majority of last night defending myself from extremely aggressive beetles.</p>\n\n<p>There was a guy on the show recently talking about his experience in AMC and selling too early: <strong>&quot;When you wake up and the price has gapped $X dollars, would you know what to do? I didn&#39;t.&quot;</strong> <em>(Note: If someone remembers his name let me know and I&#39;ll credit him here.)</em></p>\n\n<p>Now, I surely don&#39;t want to begin any kind of price anchoring here. I think he had a great point though, and it&#39;s something to think about for yourself. Even for the experienced traders among us, this situation will be foreign. I&#39;m less interested in specific numbers than just getting people to think on a different scale than they are used to, and to get people to thinking concretely about what is possible and how to manage their profits.</p>\n\n<p>I think there&#39;s some kind of magic that happens when you actually sit down and think about what you want out of life, then crunch the numbers to get there. We each make our own realities -- and there&#39;s nothing woo woo about it. Once you decide where you&#39;re going, it&#39;s much easier to get there. (<em>Psycho-Cybernetics</em>, as recommended to me by the great world champion bull rider Gary Leffew, is a good read about this; Tony Robbins&#39; book about money also has a good exercise where you write out how much your lifestyle would cost you and you usually see it&#39;s not that far out of reach.)</p>\n\n<p>At a certain point, you realize you&#39;re the creator of your own reality (whether you get there by practical goal-setting and -reaching, or more woo woo manifestation methods). Once you realize you can have anything you want, the question then isn&#39;t <em>what do you want</em>, but <em>what should you do? (</em>Lambos, yachts, whatever -- go for it if you want. No judgment here. Got to take care of yourself before you can take care of others. And I ain&#39;t ever said there&#39;s anything wrong with a little luxury.)</p>\n\n<h1>Calculating your Financial Freedom Number</h1>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a number of ways to do this, and I encourage you to go do some research about different methods. Again, the magic of actually writing this down is you see that your dreams are much more attainable - it brings them a step closer into being real rather than some fantasy clouded by your own unconscious thoughts around scarcity and your own self-worth (money and manifestation is more of a psychological game than anything else, as the SHF algorithms already know).</p>\n\n<p>Basically:</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much money do you need in order for the passive income it generates to cover your monthly/yearly living expenses?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>First, figure out your expenses</em>. Again using Tony Robbins as an example, he says you can expect to achieve financial security when these five key categories are paid off fully without having to work for them again:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Home Mortgage</li>\n<li>Utilities</li>\n<li>Food</li>\n<li>Transportation</li>\n<li>Basic insurance costs</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say there&#39;s a trader named Pepe, and for him, these all add up to about <strong>$5,000/month</strong>. Multiplied by 12 months, <strong>Pepe then needs to generate $60,000 in passive income from his investments</strong> in order to not work the dumpster behind Wendy&#39;s anymore.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Figure out the CRITICAL MASS of your freedom number</em>. The most popular method of doing this is the &quot;4% Rule,&quot; as detailed in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study\">Trinity Study</a> which states that you are financially free for life once a 4% annual withdrawal of your investments can cover your annual expenditures.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Freedom number = Annual expenses x 25 --&gt; for Pepe: 1,500,000 = ($60,000) x 25\n\n<ul>\n<li>Taking short-term capital gains (37%) into the equation: ($1,500,000) / .63 = <strong>$2,380,952</strong></li>\n<li>Divide that by your number of shares. Depending on your bullishness, you might be surprised at how possible it would be to reach that. ($238 for 10,000 shares)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now, for me, I did things a little different. I want to be financially secure, but use that as a basis to grow a business. My dream is to have a little ranch and to write. I looked up prices of land in the area I want to live in, and calculated how much I would need for a down payment in order to keep the mortgage reasonable. I went down the rabbit hole of looking up prices of used tractors and farm loans to get cows and actually crunching the numbers on mortgages (which was a kinda fun exercise in fantasy itself). I also plan on aggressively managing my portfolio and think I could manage 20% annualized returns -- though it&#39;s kind of like grazing and planning for drought years: even 10% would still be luxurious to me, and I could live off 4% if needed if there was a downturn. </p>\n\n<p>My vastly simplified numbers basically came down to two components: around $500,000 down payment on land, and another $500,000 to live off dividends ($100,000/yr @ 20% returns; $40,000 @ 4%). Around $1.6 million would give me everything I could want and more, basically, and divided by my share count seems like a completely reasonable price target for us to reach.</p>\n\n<p>I also calculated amounts for smaller dreams - $30,000 for me for example would get me out of debt and solve all my short-term problems - and that was helpful to imagine myself in the scenario where we have a stock price in the single digits. I could theoretically sell all my stock in the single digits and solve all my near-term problems.... but why would I, when if I held for a little longer I could have my dream life? I was kind of visualizing what it would feel like to hit different prices on the way up, noticing a little panic/excitement/fear at first, then smoothing it out into diamond hands.</p>\n\n<p>I remember Gary Leffew talking about visualizing himself riding the bull beforehand and I think this kind of exercise beforehand will prove to be useful when our rodeo starts. On Superstonk and elsewhere people have made videos of squeezes happening real-time to sort of simulate what it feels like when you&#39;re in the weeds in-the-moment looking at the chart (easy to see in retrospect, but when you&#39;re experiencing huge volatile swings, how will you actually react?).</p>\n\n<p>Again - no price anchoring here. TA and fundamentals should be used to calculate exit points, but knowing concretely what different amounts of money mean for your life should help prevent you from becoming a paperhanded Brandon. <strong>Don&#39;t be like Brandon.</strong> Other folks have done DD on laddering your exits if that&#39;s what you wanna do, but personally I plan on selling just the few shares I need to in order to cover some emergency short-term debts, and holding out for my financial freedom number and beyond.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I will share my vague thoughts on prices</strong>: fundamentally I believe this company is worth $60 - $80/share as it stands now. I&#39;d have to see a goddamn 10K and some financials for future but I trust in RC and believe in the long-term it&#39;s worth many multiples of that. I plan on holding the majority of my shares long-term, but also profiting on the squeeze. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s insane to think the stock could short squeeze to $1,000 (way more than my Financial Freedom Number) or b e y o  n   d. Not to mention the possibilities of multiple squeezes involved (IEP, GME, etc) Fuck, I don&#39;t know, $25k a share or more is theoretically possible - what kind of fuckery will be pulled before then, I don&#39;t know. <strong>I do believe GameStop was only the beginning - a testing sandbox for the real game.</strong> I think RC &amp; co learned a lot from the GME squeeze and things are primed for us regards this time. This won&#39;t be the last one, either. Anyway, I had fun playing with numbers and imagining the future I want for myself and for society. Maybe soon I will finally get around to writing some DD on GMERICA and the bigger plan of which I think this is a part (and has been planned for at least nearly a decade).</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps and gets you researching. <strong>Drop in the comments what your dreams are post-MOASS. I&#39;m also curious to hear realistic squeeze price targets</strong> <strong><em>and why</em></strong>, <strong>but I also don&#39;t want to cause any price anchoring or FUD (or to let SHFs know what anyone&#39;s plan is)</strong>. It&#39;s hard to guess what it&#39;s gonna be like, and personally I&#39;m gonna have to go mostly on intuition and info as it&#39;s happening. My point is, we&#39;ve been beaten down so long that many people might be happy with, say, $2.50, but hopefully most know by now that is far, far, FAR too low of a price. Might be good to be prepared for something like $2.50 in the near term, possibly some volatile price action, and then a slow squeeze over a few more months. Easier to keep holding longer if you know you&#39;ll get everything you want by the end of it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/147065h/video/rqsbljp6ef5b1/player\">https://reddit.com/link/147065h/video/rqsbljp6ef5b1/player</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_Wg3navJqROLLKX3HjV8TjKcXAV_NEAVU0lk7X7Qku0.jpg\"/></div>"},

It&#39;s metaphors, m&#39;apes. Sure, these connections might be all in our head -- but maybe our heads are a lot bigger than we think?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Today, May 27th, marks the 147th day of the year</strong> - a day sacred to all those who follow boobies and jimmies. It also marks the end of Shavuot and the Counting of the Omer. If you read my Passover DD, which I wrote half-jokingly and also earned me a ban from the main sub, I noted that Shavuot is one of the three major pilgrimage festivals in Judaism - because in the old days, these trips would take a very long time, and so their entire years were planned around these dates - and directly linked to Passover. (The gents among us might know it as &quot;the pentecost.&quot;)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you recall the story of passover, basically the pharaoh and moses have a showdown as moses demands freedom of his people from slavery. But the pharaoh is like nah bro, so god decides to help Moses out by killing all the firstborn children in the kingdom if the house didn&#39;t mark their doors with the blood of a sacrificed lamb.</p>\n\n<p><em>(Note: I don&#39;t recommend doing this, even though we are a cult.</em> <strong><em>It&#39;s a metaphor for tallying up registered shares.</em></strong><em>)</em></p>\n\n<p>So the Israelites have to leave with their shitty unleavened bread, since they didn&#39;t have time to wait for the bread to rise. (<strong><em>It&#39;s a metaphor for our stock price.</em></strong>)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wwql8cfyyg2b1.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7a7911891caae1a105517ab86c489d64cd8a07b\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/wwql8cfyyg2b1.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7a7911891caae1a105517ab86c489d64cd8a07b\" alt=\"Ah, remember the good old days, a month ago, when $.31 was considered \\&quot;low\\&quot; and not \\&quot;high\\&quot;.... it&#39;s just an ice cream cone to me though\"></a></p>\n\n<p>And when we last left our hero, he had split the <del>buybuyBABY</del>  red sea, drowning the pharaoh in a red sea of his own greed aka mayo...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bpbheahetg2b1.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22049f8dcc079b36d7603d61759c7bdd7e5ac0e5\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/bpbheahetg2b1.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22049f8dcc079b36d7603d61759c7bdd7e5ac0e5\" alt=\"also me upon realizing that MOASS has started (I&#39;m a MOASS guy what can I say)\"></a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>A happy end to Passover - or so they thought. Thus began the <strong>Exodus</strong> -- you may have heard of it. This is not to historical accuracy, but basically the Israelites were stuck wandering around the desert for like 50 days or some shit until god revealed the torah to moses. It was hot as shit and they were hungry, but fortunately moses provided them with water and manna (<strong><em>it&#39;s a metaphor for these small green days we&#39;ve had</em></strong>).</p>\n\n<p>Shavuot is now celebrated as an agricultural holiday, celebrating the wheat harvest and the fruits (\ud83c\udf4fs &amp; \ud83c\udf4cs) of our hard WORK. Whereas Passover seems almost restrictive and kind of lame with all that unleavened bread, during Shavuot, a sampling of the first wheat harvest is <strong>baked into two loaves of leavened bread</strong>. <em>(Leavening is a metaphor for excess stock prices if you didn&#39;t pick that up. Aka squeeze.)</em></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x123pyap1h2b1.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=744b2416eef9d8ba0cc5dde683aa4675af337b7e\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/x123pyap1h2b1.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=744b2416eef9d8ba0cc5dde683aa4675af337b7e\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/x123pyap1h2b1.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=744b2416eef9d8ba0cc5dde683aa4675af337b7e\"></a></p>\n\n<p>&quot;The act of counting the Omer emphasizes the special connection between the two holidays: P<strong>assover stands for physical liberation and Shavuot stands for spiritual liberation</strong>. During the period of slavery in Egypt, the [morale] of the Jewish people had sunken to a low level. Thus, the time between Passover and <strong>Shavuot is seen as a period of growth and self-improvement in preparation to receive the Torah</strong>. The 49 days of the Omer period also stand for the 49 Gates of Understanding.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dv8trnii9h2b1.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40063db44582c6c7b42fe0ececa1a17908a200a8\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/dv8trnii9h2b1.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40063db44582c6c7b42fe0ececa1a17908a200a8\" alt=\"RC bringing the harvest.

When you know you can have anything you want -- when you&#39;re at that level that you realize you are basically co-creator of your own universe, and anything could be yours in the blink of an eye -- doesn&#39;t a lot of what you used to want fall away? Nothing wrong with a little luxury and taking care of yourself, but once you&#39;ve secured yourself materially, the question is no longer <em>what do I want?</em> but <em>what am I going to do? How am I going to act?</em></p>\n\n<p>I do think there is something transformative about this experience. The rabbit holes we&#39;ve been down, this thing we&#39;ve created that&#39;s even bigger than ourselves, but of which we are all still an important part. I&#39;ve learned a lot about myself and the world. I&#39;ve had to cultivate balance and patience; it&#39;s made me a better communicator, and a better member of any community of which I&#39;m a part.

But I think it is. Ready for the downvotes and cries of unrealism. But AAPL dropped filings about a five-part, five-billy debt offering today, offering 1.35% more than comparable U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/apple-with-net-cash-of-57-billion-plans-five-part-bond-sale\">https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/apple-with-net-cash-of-57-billion-plans-five-part-bond-sale</a></p>\n\n<p>If you haven&#39;t been following the macro -- basically, these long-dated bonds were a reason for the recent bank collapses. Well, stupid and greedy bankers are the reason. To sum it up though, basically banks were putting customers&#39; deposits in these thirty year bonds without regard for the fact that the Fed has been raising interest rates relentlessly. Rising interest rates slashed the value of these longer-dated bonds -- when interest rates go up, the market price of older bonds goes down because new bonds pay out higher interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>That in itself would not be a big deal -- just hide it in the books as &quot;unrealized losses.&quot; But someone noticed these &quot;unrealized losses&quot; and got worried [and told their buddies too]. So when depositors pulled their money out, the banks had to sell at current market price, realizing their losses.</p>\n\n<p>Apple also wants to become cash-neutral. Which would be great if they essentially became a piggy bank -- all capital deployed, no volatility. Safe returns. Profits returned to shareholders and reinvested into the business. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-apple-inc-tim-cook-business-d056553b10120c4a968b562cb7ece5d2#:%7E:text=Cook%20has%20received%20a%20%243,the%20changes%20to%20his%20compensation\">Tim Cook taking a 40% pay cut over last year because he listened to shareholders.</a> Carl&#39;s IEP is also a notoriously stable stock -- share price has been incredibly stable while returning 18 percent dividends.</p>\n\n<p>To me it seems like Apple is about to take on the weight of the entire economy, lol. This would be a better place for banks to stash their money than bonds. We&#39;re also sitting at about five percent inflation [although personally I think that&#39;s a gross underestimate and doesnt capture the whole picture but whatever] which is about what the Apple bonds will pay off.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t forget that not only did RC invest most of his money in Apple, along with the DFV apple tweets, CO_RY tweeting about apples and bananas, but Icahn was also heavily involved with Apple [according to the HBO doc, it was actually Brett who convinced him to do the deal -- and it paid off handsomely]. That was actually around 2015... right about when the &quot;white cat&quot; first posted in the GME subreddit.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has also been successful with offering high-yield savings accounts, and moving towards peer-to-peer direct payments.... BBBY and GME both making moves to sort of become tech companies, too. Do you think Tim Cook would miss out on web3? Or do you think he would quietly, privately be helping to build and guide it? Similarly, if you were RC and trying to overhaul tech and stocks and commerce altogether, would you try to do it behind Apple&#39;s back, or would you try to get them on board?</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention Apple&#39;s development of augmented reality coming soon... would make for a real nice web3 shopping experience if I do say so myself. No expensive leases that lock you in long-term in the metaverse beyond...</p>\n\n<p>The Street article I linked also mentions Warren Buffett is bullish on the idea. Saw another post &#39;round Reddit saying Warren Buffett confirms having a convo with RC lately though I can&#39;t confirm this myself.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure exactly WHAT is brewing... but I think it is huge. Just my opinion.

Given that it seems there&#39;s an investigation [see beginning of this post], and the company&#39;s acknowledgement of naked shorting, I think that argument would be easy to make. Additionally, in 2017, the SEC began <a href=\"https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/transactional/capital-markets/publications/sec-permits-all-issuers-to-submit-certain-registration-statements-on-a-confidential-basis?id=24514\">allowing all issuers to submit certain registration statements confidentially</a>.

And standstills are a whole other can of worms you can dig into...</p>\n\n<p>As my AA sponsor always says, &quot;More will be revealed.&quot; When the time is right. I trust the company, especially after re-reading RC&#39;s letter to the Board, and considering his standstill agreement.</p>\n\n<p>Just to jack your tits more:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Napkin math:</strong> A nice fellow asked about price targets. I used to find it annoying when DFV and others would say &quot;no target, just up.&quot; But more and more, that really resonates with me. I first came in to GME two years ago as a degenerate gambler desperate to make a quick buck, but after watching DFV&#39;s videos and the Icahn doc on HBO, I&#39;m really understanding how a deep value play is much, much better. Good luck timing the markets [and this is coming from someone who believes in astrology -- though isn&#39;t the stock market just astrology for men?] but <strong>here&#39;s a basic framework:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you look at GME, it went from [these are post-split prices] $1 to $80 - extrapolate that to BBBY would put BBBY at around <strong>$24</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>However - keep in mind that was based solely on GME shorts [and retail call buying], no M/As etc. I think BBBY is going to spin off BBB in a reverse merger with Teddy LLC. BBBY will likely be owned by some private equity company, Newell or other [maaaybe acquired by GME? kind of doubt it].</p>\n\n<p><strong>$24 still seems extremely low price for BBBY to me</strong>. I should do some proper calculations of its value based on market cap and what BBBY + BBB are both worth. But RC&#39;s letter states he thinks BBB alone is worth <strong>several billion, on top of BBBY being extremely undervalued.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also keep in mind: at its peak in 2014 <strong>GME&#39;s price was around $13</strong> before it went down to <strong>$1</strong> before the squeeze; also in 2014, <strong>BBBY at its peak was around $75</strong>, and its now trading at goddamn <strong>.30 cents</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Like... holy shit. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/comments/12dh7qs/a_normal_day_in_german_television/\">Real life picture of me after selling my plasma to buy the dip</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention, with the current abortion bans, BBB seems like a good play....... /morbidsadjoke \ud83d\ude14</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, cheers.

Additionally, in 2017, the SEC began [allowing all issuers to submit certain registration statements confidentially](https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/transactional/capital-markets/publications/sec-permits-all-issuers-to-submit-certain-registration-statements-on-a-confidential-basis?id=24514). \\[More info [here](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/voluntary-submission-draft-registration-statements-faqs#:~:text=Yes.,information%20in%20its%20comment%20letters), though it's not really necessary.\\]\n\n[Lots of articles](https://investmentbank.com/confidentiality/) out there about the need for confidentiality during M/As as well, and how they involve standstill agreements. And standstills are a whole other can of worms you can dig into...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs my AA sponsor always says, \"More will be revealed.\" When the time is right. I trust the company, especially after re-reading RC's letter to the Board, and considering his standstill agreement. \n\nJust to jack your tits more:\n\n**Napkin math:** A nice fellow asked about price targets. I used to find it annoying when DFV and others would say \"no target, just up.\" But more and more, that really resonates with me. I first came in to GME two years ago as a degenerate gambler desperate to make a quick buck, but after watching DFV's videos and the Icahn doc on HBO, I'm really understanding how a deep value play is much, much better. Good luck timing the markets \\[and this is coming from someone who believes in astrology -- though isn't the stock market just astrology for men?\\] but **here's a basic framework:**\n\nIf you look at GME, it went from \\[these are post-split prices\\] $1 to $80 - extrapolate that to BBBY would put BBBY at around **$24**.\n\nHowever - keep in mind that was based solely on GME shorts \\[and retail call buying\\], no M/As etc. I think BBBY is going to spin off BBB in a reverse merger with Teddy LLC. BBBY will likely be owned by some private equity company, Newell or other \\[maaaybe acquired by GME? kind of doubt it\\].\n\n**$24 still seems extremely low price for BBBY to me**. I should do some proper calculations of its value based on market cap and what BBBY + BBB are both worth. But RC's letter states he thinks BBB alone is worth **several billion, on top of BBBY being extremely undervalued.**\n\nAlso keep in mind: at its peak in 2014 **GME's price was around $13** before it went down to **$1** before the squeeze; also in 2014, **BBBY at its peak was around $75**, and its now trading at goddamn **.30 cents**.\n\nLike... holy shit. [Real life picture of me after selling my plasma to buy the dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/comments/12dh7qs/a_normal_day_in_german_television/).\n\nNot to mention, with the current abortion bans, BBB seems like a good play....... /morbidsadjoke \ud83d\ude14 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, cheers. I hope all of your's days are filled with **magical moments**.
