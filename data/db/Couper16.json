It first invested in P&amp;G, J&amp;J, UPS, and Mondelez in the 2000s, and GM in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Berkshire also reduced its stakes in Amazon, Aon, Chevron, HP, Markel, and Globe Life. On the other hand, it disclosed new positions in SiriusXM, as well as the Atlanta Braves and both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; shares of Liberty Media Live, which stemmed from the spin-off of the Braves into a separate public company this summer.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, Berkshire omitted one or more holdings from its public portfolio update and requested the SEC treat them as confidential for now. Buffett and his team asked for and received the same discretion when they were building stakes in Chevron, Verizon, and Marsh &amp; McLennan in 2020, as they feared disclosing the incomplete wagers would drive up the stocks&#39; prices and increase their cost bases.</p>\n\n<p>Berkshire&#39;s batch of stock sales was foreshadowed by its latest earnings, which showed the company spent only $1.7 billion on stocks but sold $7 billion worth last quarter. The conglomerate&#39;s cash pile also swelled to a record $157 billion, suggesting Buffett and his colleagues struggled to find bargains in the period.</p>\n\n<p>Buffett and his colleagues made similar tweaks to their stock portfolio in the second quarter. They switched out three holdings and pared several others, while also taking stakes in a trio of homebuilders.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-reveals-175513888.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-reveals-175513888.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Berkshire&#39;s vice chairman and Buffett&#39;s business partner, Charlie Munger, hinted he had soured on GM during a recent podcast. &quot;In its heyday, General Motors was a great company \u2014 it  just gradually went to hell one contract at a time,&quot; he said.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

As reported by CNN, the DOJ has indicted Smartmatic for rigging an election in the Philippines and Patrick Byrne says he\u2019s involved in the background of this case and he says that this indictment means that \u201cThey are done.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>election tampering.</p>\n\n<p>A US Prosecutor in Florida brought this case because a US bank was used to make money transfers in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). He then left the DOJ and he\u2019s now working on Patrick Byrne\u2019s legal team!</p>\n\n<p>Patrick says that this is the most important breach in the opponent\u2019s defense since they stole the election on November 3rd, 2020, because the Department of Justice and an American grand jury has looked at this and said, \u2018Yes, elections are riggable with these machines and Smartmatic did it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The same Smartmatic operating system is used in the voting machines produced by Hart InterCivic, ES&amp;S and Dominion. The question then becomes, \u201cWhy did Fox pay?\u201c</p>\n\n<p>Because, Patrick says, \u201cFox is dirty. I think you\u2019re going to see Fox get sold and that great big payment that was made is actually part of stuff going on \u2013 you\u2019re going to see Fox sold. I believe\u2026to State Street \u2013 same company that bought Dominion! Huh! Wouldn\u2019t it be funny, if State Street buys Fox? Would that start making any sense to you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Patrick then directly addressed the military and the DOJ:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEvery part of the American government, you should be going in and telling your boss that, given these developments, you have misgivings, that you need guidance, that you need legal guidance \u2013 flood the zone! Flood your Internal Affairs guys, flood your legal departments, professional responsibility, ask them for advice\u2026We need you, from within to flood the zone up. And if you all do it at once, they can\u2019t fire you all.
