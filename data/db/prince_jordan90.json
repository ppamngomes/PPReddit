The stock really shot up in that last hour of trading (another cohencidence of course).</p>\n\n<p>We received the NT 10-K form on April 26th which gives BBBY 15 additional calendar days to complete it. That would put a max date of May 11th as the date to release the late 10K (a merger or acquisition is a common reason for a late filing, but they also did just declare bankruptcy as well).</p>\n\n<p>The last 10K contained the outstanding share count, so if this one holds to tradition then we may finally learn what the true TSO actually is. Couple this 10K with the shareholder equity count from Friday and we may have some fireworks (sprinkle in a M/A as well and ohhhhhhh boy) \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
