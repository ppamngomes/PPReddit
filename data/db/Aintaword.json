So. </p>\n\n<p>Both are retailers. Well, Big Lots is. Bed Bath and Beyond was. Both have had some financial opportunities. BIG has kept its head above water and kept its stores open. Both have seen their stock prices fall. BIG didn&#39;t fall quiet as low as BBBYQ, but, hey, it can&#39;t go any lower, right!? </p>\n\n<p>Point is, y&#39;all, I think if you&#39;re looking for the next low cost stock to stump for, it&#39;s Big Lots BIG. Four dollars and change right now. Big Lots is a retailer, so you&#39;ve got that familiarity. It has a similar stock of merchandise. Hell, they may be selling old Bed Bath and Beyond merch right now. </p>\n\n<p>So yeah. Have a look.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
