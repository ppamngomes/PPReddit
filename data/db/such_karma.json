That day, we won- they lost. But they\u2019ve cheated you and your brothers and sisters a shot at changing things around for their lives. Paying off debt for our family and friends, buying our loved ones a place to live. I thank God every day for GME, BBBY, Loopring, IEP, BRK, XRP, Overstock, TSLA, and other what I consider righteous fighters against a very present and real evil. A lot of us are barely hanging on, and I\u2019ve spoken with many of you- it truly is food stamps or lambos. But for what I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s no longer about lambos to me. Lambos are just possessions that will only temporarily bandaid a deeper need for connection with others. To know that we all went through the same hellfire brought by the snakes and vipers and survived, I applaud you and commend you all. You all are warriors, and I thank the PP community for what you do- SS is compromised and I thought the Banks won the fight in killing community engagement: but though PP is small, I sense a great explosion once MOASS is said and done. I pray for all of us holders that we would continue to let truth guide our visions and to be worthy of this blessing that I know I don\u2019t deserve. Hang on, we\u2019re almost there, Rocky. We\u2019re all going to make it.
