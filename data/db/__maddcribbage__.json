I wipe my ass on the carpet and go outside twice a year.</p>\n\n<p>Seemingly overnight this sub went from having a reasonable take on DRS to conflating fearmongering with support for direct registration. This is some wack af, soft PP energy that I am here to temper.</p>\n\n<p>In general, I am sure we can all agree that raising awareness of DRS is a good thing. However, DRSing is a personal choice that is not available to everyone invested in this stock. I am seeing a lot of posts leveraging <strong>fear</strong> in order to promote DRS, rather than educating folks on the benefits of DRSing, explaining the pracitical implications of holding DRS&#39;d shares with AST in the event of a squeeze, or even just explaining how to DRS at all in the first place. <strong>If you are one of these commenters, how do you think your fearmongering is affecting the emotional state of those unable to DRS?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A common sentiment expressed here since we moved to the expert market has been, &quot;Wow! I was so stressed with my shares being held in a brokerage, but now that I am 100% DRS&#39;d I am at ease.&quot; If this is you, you are doing the memestock equivalent of yelling FIRE in a crowded theatre.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The implications floating around that shares will be liquidated, cancelled, forced to close, etc is speculative FUD! The implications floating around that DRSing actually protects your investment on a practical level anymore than broker-held shares for the upcoming exit from Chapter 11 is speculative hopium!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Very few of these fearmongering DRS posts/comments mention fineprint asterisks like: broker&#39;s legal obligations to NBBO; how DRS&#39;d shares held in Plan are no more secure from short sellers than non-DRS&#39;d shares; how AST only offers open market orders for selling; etc.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some practical implications I am seeing left out of the conversation recently. DRS (+ Book holding)  offers investment security for those interested in holding the stock <em>through</em> the upcoming short squeeze, while making it more difficult for an investor to maximize returns if they would rather sell <em>into</em> that squeeze.  Holding in brokerages offers minimal investment security in a black swan event, while allowing investors to maximize gains through limit orders during a squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>While I fucking love the tinfoil like the degen I am, I prefer to keep that tinfoil positive. Since expert market, the tinfoil got negative af. I gotta keep it real when I start seeing folks making anxious decisions born from FUD, rather than measured understanding.</p>\n\n<p>DRS&#39;d or not, WAGMI.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff4500"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
