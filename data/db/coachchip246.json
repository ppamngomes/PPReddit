(Referenced HBC was search as mentioned in BBBY's 14 Mar 23 filing referring specifically \"c/o ***Hudson Bay Capital Management LP***\").\n\n\\---\n\nNow take a look from Tilray's (TLRY) 13G filings in ***Feb 23***.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zg02tf6totna1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=be694e730240d7384032f21397a22801865c4c40\n\nItem 2(a).

OWNERSHIP\n\nThe ***Investment Manager serves as the investment manager to*** HT Investments MA LLC, in whose name the convertible notes reported herein are held. As such, the ***Investment Manager may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of all shares*** of Class 2 Common Stock, subject to the 9.99% Blocker, ***underlying the convertible notes held*** by HT Investments MA LLC. ***Mr. Gerber serves as the managing member of Hudson Bay Capital GP LLC, which is the general partner of the Investment Manager.*** Mr. Gerber disclaims beneficial ownership of these securities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og7qtxqvotna1.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=657cde288ee4b93e5e078955091e5f6ca316f34d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u9lsklgwotna1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=803423ecfcf6284b5d0d339deabb51987294bdcd\n\nSo in BBBY's case, could HBC just be an Investment manager on behalf of another person/entity involved.?.?.?\n\n\\---\n\nHaven't had much time to dig into HT Investments (High Trail Investments) to establish links to anyone else or if that rabbit hole comes to a dead end, but does seem like a hedge fund that invests in low-cap companies.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1393825/000139382523000172/tlry\\_13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1393825/000139382523000172/tlry_13g.htm)", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/N2nFE1c8_Hbnv-SHA4-q4-kQdMo9rhafP3UROJLU4d0.jpg\"/></div>"},
