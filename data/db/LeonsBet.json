Okay I am trying to interpret [almost everything should be in quotes]: </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Frightening close on January 28th&quot; [2021] </p>\n\n<p>50 million registered shares  </p>\n\n<p>Same time as 70 million shares short </p>\n\n<p>and 150 million shares short by a _[boat?]__ short _[short?]_ options* </p>\n\n<p>If the *___ short options had been exercised, the shorts would have had to deliver 270 million shares &quot;while only 50 million shares existed&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So as the rule goes today, the loan broker has to go into the market and buy the shares at whatever the price is</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So that could have pushed the price further up into the thousands&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;When that happens, obviously the shorts cannot pay up so the brokers... they default on the brokers, the brokers default on the clearing house, and the whole thing is a huge mess that&#39;s impossible to untangle&quot;</p>\n\n<p>His solution (head of IBKR, which is big in options): </p>\n\n<p>1) Have the short positions published once a day, which we currently have it only twice a month. </p>\n\n<p>2) SEC would have to require brokers to charge an extra 1% margin for every 1% of short interest </p>\n\n<p>That would raise the margins so progressively high, that people would stop shorting stocks.</p>\n\n<p>[Then Peterffy said they increased their margins (at IBKR), which the interview asserted was due to regulator pressure]</p>\n\n<p>He then says he does not know the short interest daily and that could be important to know</p>\n\n<p>[I only got to 2:50 and taking a break now. I&#39;ll edit if I heard something wrong. I think his accident is Hungarian.]</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#94e044"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yq4jdShG_PU/hqdefault.jpg\"/></div>"},
