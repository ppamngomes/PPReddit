CONTINUITY OF INTEREST A. Overview For a transaction to qualify as a tax-free restructuring under Section 368, the transaction must meet the continuity of interest (&quot;COI&quot;) requirement. 4 Thus, by acquiring the shares of the acquiring company, the historical shareholders of the target company must have an ongoing interest in the target assets and the target business. This requirement originated in cases dating back to Pinellas Ice &amp; Cold Storage v Commissioner, 5 and Helvering v Minnesota Tea Co. 6 The Internal Revenue Service (\u201cService\u201d or \u201cIRS\u201d) considers the continuity of interest requirement to be met if, after the transaction, historical shareholders of the target company hold shares in the acquiring company (due to prior ownership of the target shares). account for at least 50% of the share value of the target company.

This is characterized by the fact that the business assets are transferred to the prospective buyer by way of an asset deal without the insolvency liabilities. The transferring reorganisation by means of a share deal after the transfer of the assets of the insolvent company to a special purpose entity is very rare, because this alternative is less attractive for the buyer for liability and tax reasons. The insolvency administrator acts as the seller (in the case of self-administration, the debtor company is acting through its management).</p>\n\n<p>In terms of time, the transferred restructuring can be implemented more quickly than the trade sale in the course of an insolvency plan procedure, which is outlined below (clause 2.).</p>\n\n<p>In terms of time, the transferred restructuring can be implemented more quickly than the trade sale in the course of an insolvency plan procedure, which is outlined below (clause 2.).</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;The conclusion of a trade sale agreement within the scope of a transferring reorganisation is (in any case) possible from the opening of insolvency proceedings on, as the insolvency administrator then has the power of disposal over the proprietary company. However, the preceding insolvency proceedings can sometimes be used for a due diligence examination by the prospective buyer, with the consequence that the conclusion of the contract is possible as soon as the insolvency proceedings are opened. Such a procedure is in line with the interest of the insolvency administrator, who often also wants to achieve a quick conclusion of the contract in order to enable the continuation of the company. In this way he can also reduce the risk of a loss of value of the company, which increases over time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "", "text_color": "", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Bidders for bankrupt companies generally operate in related industries and often have a prior relationship with the target company, indicating that they are well informed about both the value and the best use of the target company&#39;s assets. For a sample of 55 acquisitions in Chapter 11, we find that firms that merge with bankrupt target firms show significant improvement in operating performance, while corresponding non-bankrupt transactions show no significant improvement.
