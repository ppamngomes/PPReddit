There even was a sub for this and I waited \u2013 and waited \u2013 and waited. Nothing happened, no theory came to fruition. HOWEVER: They still are in my account, confirming that they probably remain worthless. BBBYQ at least DOES something. This actually makes me feel like there is SOMETHING going on.
