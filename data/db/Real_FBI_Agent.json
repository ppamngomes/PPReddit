In life, we all make mistakes or misjudge situations, and that\u2019s a part of the learning process. It\u2019s vital to remember that being wrong doesn\u2019t diminish your value as a person or your credibility, it just means you have an opportunity to grow and learn.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve never come across someone who cares so deeply about a matter in which they have no stake or \u201cskin in the game.\u201d It amazes me, and it makes one wonder, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n\n<pre><code>1.  Ego Protection: For some, being right bolsters their self-esteem and helps them maintain a positive self-image.\n2.  Desire for Consistency: People naturally seek consistency in their beliefs and actions. Admitting to being wrong can disrupt this internal harmony.\n3.  Fear of Judgement: Some might fear that changing their stance or admitting error might lead to criticism or ridicule from peers.\n4.  Seeking Control: Being right can give one a sense of control in an uncertain world or in situations where they might otherwise feel powerless.\n5.  Intellectual Stimulation: Engaging in debates and defending one\u2019s viewpoint can be mentally stimulating and provide a sense of purpose.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I think it\u2019s important to approach such these guys with compassion and an open heart\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p>\n\n<p>NOT.
