I called computershare and they stated that it had not been 5 days yet of the 3-5 business days. I started that process Friday of last week. Fidelity was pretty sketchy when I called them to drs they told me that they couldn\u2019t direct register any shares while shares are still currently settling in my account and then when I stated that I\u2019m not new to this process and that when I transferred my gme shares some where still settling in my account when I transferred those that are settled and they went through. Anyways call it paranoia but I sense that something is happening with them locating shares. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "TRUST ME BRO", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ea0027"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

This can benefit passion projects via video game developers to help fund video games in the works as well. I think having a one stop shop for streaming services and games would create a cohesive environment for game developers to receive feed back from their main supporters and customers providing feed back to their favorite game devs.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
