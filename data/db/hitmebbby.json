The narrative was that they were completely gone with no scenario where i could get them back. When I quoted the earlier T212 post he backtracked a little and said that of course if something changes I would realise the value. He also said that there is no precedent for that. </p>\n\n<p>However, the really interesting thing is that there is no record off the chat on my chat history. All other chats are there but not this one. Not really sure what that means but it sounds dodgy as fuck. </p>\n\n<p>He did again confirm that they are completely dependant on the IBKR stance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

There have been multiple negative news stories, multiple negative dockets released but we are still trading between 0.20 and 0.40 - normally within 2-3 cents +/-0.30. It almost feels as though there are players (good or bad) that have a vested interest in maintaining this narrow channel. It makes no sense to me that bad actors can stop it at 0.30 but can\u2019t knock it down sub 0.20.

For me that \u2018something\u2019 is \u2018freedom\u2019. Freedom from debt and all of the unnecessary stress and suffering that debt can bring. Freedom from the uncertainty about how I can support my kids in the future and make them the best humans they can be. </p>\n\n<p>I genuinely don\u2019t want a Lamborghini. I just want to be free from all the shit I\u2019ve dealt with for the past few years. I want my kids to be comfortable, but not so comfortable that they don\u2019t learn a work ethic or don\u2019t learn to have empathy with those who have less than they do. </p>\n\n<p>So I think we as a community should make a pledge to pay it forward. Whether Bill is involved or not his philanthropic approach is admirable. If we succeed in our goals I will personally donate 25% of my net profit (after debts/taxes are paid!) to a just cause. I feel like that\u2019s fair because this will be money that I never would have had before and I recognise that there are people in the world that are in a much worse situation than I am. </p>\n\n<p>This should be a movement to redistribute wealth to those who need it most.
