Last night my partener and I both had wildly vivid dreams.  We both remembered every detail.  Also, in the middle of the night our pup started freaking out, very unusual then crash!  Our picture board in the kitchen fell off the wall.  We both jumped out of bed like WTF.  Needless to say we went out into our kitchen to asses what happened.  We then tried going back to sleep and neither of us could, we both said something feels weird or off.  Can&#39;t explain what but something.  Then literally just right now our dog leash hanger fell off the wall in the kitchen.  Startled the shit out of me I was like wtf, two separate things mounted on our kitchen walls fall off, that&#39;s extremely weird.  Something in the universe is trying to communicate with us.  I pick up the dog leash hanger and what do I see staring right at me on the back of it.  Yup, that&#39;s right.  We&#39;ve won, I&#39;m absolutely convinced.  Unwavering conviction. There is no fucking way these are just cohencidences.  Trust me bro.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/uu34fz7nvmsb1.jpg\"/></div>"},
