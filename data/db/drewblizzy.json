Anyway, the date here and the frequency stuck out to me\u2026 March 1, 2022 .. Every 6 weeks. So I wrote down the dates of \u201cEvery 6 weeks\u201d before and after 3/1/22 (second slide). Next, I went thru RC\u2019s tweets and made note of tweets on these dates and found some interesting cohencidences, but just wanted to get this out there so maybe more eyes and better ideas can run with my thought. </p>\n\n<p>Probably nothing, but third slide shows one thought I had. I went backwards 6 weeks one, four, and seven times. If we go with the prophetic 741, the order would be:</p>\n\n<p>Back Six weeks 7 times, date 5/11/21 - \n\u201cGive me liberty, or give me death\u201d tweet was on 5/11/22</p>\n\n<p>Back Six weeks 4 times, date 9/14/21 - \nno tweet this date in any year</p>\n\n<p>Back Six weeks 1 time, date 1/18/22 - \n\u201cRyan Cohen buys all stocks\u201d tweet was on 1/18/23</p>\n\n<p>So looking thru all of RCs tweets, it was apparent to me that he likes to tweet things on the dates of certain events, just a year or two in advance or in retrospect. One data point to support this is RC\u2019s chopsticks tweet on 7/18/21 that we all theorized indicated a split\u2026well record date for our splivvy was 7/18/22 \ud83d\udc40 Anyway, It was early September when I wrote this stuff down, but based on my thinking, I expected 9/14 to have something of significance. Lo and behold, it ended up being the date the Plan was accepted, effective immediately (as you can see by my drunken timestamp on slide 2 the exact moment I actually found out \ud83d\ude2d). </p>\n\n<p>My question/challenge to anyone who sees this\u2026 did anything of significance occur on or around 1/18 or 5/11 of this year (or any of the dates I wrote down for that matter). And if so, would that mean one of these dates listed is the next big date. By the way, all of these dates I wrote down are Tuesdays, so it would fit the Tuesday Morning tweet \ud83d\ude09</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, 11/23/22 was the \u201cTeddy making Thanksgiving great again\u201d tweet. 11/23/22 wasn\u2019t Thanksgiving, but 11/23/23 sure is (again, a tweet 1 year in advance)! Closest date I wrote down meeting the every 6 weeks criteria would be 11/21/23.  Well 11/21/21 was the \u201cSex for dummies\u201d tweet. How great would it be if on 11/21/23, Teddy officially released and was traded on tZero (DEX, not CEX), just in time for Thanksgiving.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry if anyone feels like this post was a waste of time, but also if you feel that way fuck you and have a good night \ud83d\ude02</p>\n\n<p>PS: 10/26/21 was the David vs Goliath tweet, and although 10/26/23 is a Thursday, that\u2019s one of my favorite tweets of RC\u2019s. It\u2019s a hopeful date of mine, but for no other reason than I like the tweet lol RC &amp; Friends (David) vs Amazon (Goliath).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-Xyz-jtFywBaiQQh4yLwGV3NfZ5LYhFoEA4N-VtEOM4.jpg\"/></div>"},
