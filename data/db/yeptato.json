See Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.368- 1(d)(3)(i). The old loss corporation\u2019s historic business assets are the assets used in its historic business. These assets can include stock and securities and intangible operating assets</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>TLDR: <a href=\"/u/jake2b\">/u/jake2b</a> contends that since BBBY has sold off basically all their assets, any buyer wanting the NOLs would want to ensure shareholders remained intact to satisfy the continuing assets requirement.</p>\n\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Shareholders are not assets</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>IFRS has a very clear definition of what assets and equity are (see <a href=\"https://www.iasplus.com/en/standards/other/framework\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>An asset is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Generally, economic benefits refer to future cash flow. For example, if you own a farm, you can recognize a tractor as an asset because you will use the tractor to harvest crops which you will then sell to generate future cash flow.</p>\n\n<p>Shareholders are not assets because you do gain any future economic benefits from simply having shareholders. They have <strong>claim</strong> to residual assets (because shareholders are owners) after subtracting liabilities, but they are not assets themselves.</p>\n\n<p>You may say &quot;But wait! Shareholders can infuse cash which is an economic benefit expected to flow to the entity! Or the company can issue shares to raise cash!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Then the cash itself becomes the asset (because you can use cash to operate a business), and shareholders get to increase their claim over residual assets by an equivalent amount (this is a concept called <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-entry.asp\">double-entry bookkeeping</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Again, the shareholders themselves are not assets. You cannot pay employee salaries in shareholders, you cannot sell shareholder BJs behind Wendy&#39;s, you can&#39;t generate future economic benefit from simply having shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, recognition of an asset has specific criteria to meet:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>An asset is recognised in the balance sheet when it is <strong>probable</strong> that the future economic benefits will flow to the entity and the asset has a cost or value that can be measured reliably.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if you contend that shareholders can provide future economic benefit (i.e. future cash flows), there is no way to determine if that is probable or not. IFRS defines &quot;probable&quot; as &quot;more likely than not&quot;. Going back to the tractor, if I buy a tractor for my farm, I&#39;m more likely than not to use it for farming. If I&#39;m BBBY and I buy a bunch of towels, more likely than not, I&#39;m going to sell them for money. There is no way to determine the likelihood that an existing shareholder would provide a future economic benefit.</p>\n\n<p>One of the key tenets of accounting is <strong>conservatism</strong>, which means if you are uncertain about the probability of something, you err on the side of conservatism and do not recognize an asset (or income) until it becomes probable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now you may ask, &quot;well why the fuck did jake&#39;s source say stock and securities then!?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Great question. This is referring to the company&#39;s investments in <strong>other</strong> stocks and securities (i.e. not their own stock). Typically this happens when companies hold a lot of cash and instead of watching it disappear to inflation, they will park it in short-term investments or money market securities.</p>\n\n<p>See examples here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple in their latest <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_earnings/2023/q3/filing/_10-Q-Q3-2023-As-Filed.pdf\">10-Q</a> (pg 6) had $34B of marketable securities under assets. See Note 3 (pg 10) for a breakdown of what&#39;s included in marketable securities (mostly corporate bonds and non-US gov securities)</li>\n<li>Microsoft had $77B in short-term investments (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017023014423/msft-20230331.htm#balance_sheets\">10Q</a>) under assets. See Note 4 (pg 13) for a breakdown of what&#39;s included in the $77B (mostly US gov securities)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll notice that none of these companies (or any other ones) have classified their shareholders as assets. <strong>That&#39;s because they&#39;re not.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not a tax specialist (those that are, please feel free to correct me), but in general, the reason why the tax code calls this out specifically is because without this clarification, one could argue that a company&#39;s holdings in stocks and securities should not contribute towards business continuity if the historic business was not in the business of buying and selling stocks and securities.</p>\n\n<p>For example, imagine BBBY had $500m of short-term investments in other companies. Without this clarification in the tax code, one could argue a buyer who bought those investments does not meet the continuity test because BBBY was in the business of selling towels, not stocks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lastly, one may point out &quot;But yeptato, those are accounting definitions, not legal ones! The Court may define assets differently!&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lawyers, feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but as far as I&#39;m aware, in the area of tax law, the definitions are the same. In my country (Canada), tax lawyers actually attend the same post-certification courses as tax specialists.</p>\n\n<p>So there you have it, my take on why <a href=\"/u/jake2b\">/u/jake2b</a> is wrong again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> <a href=\"/u/jake2b\">/u/jake2b</a> <strong>is wrong again, shareholders are not assets.</strong></p>\n\n<p>My credentials in case they matter: CPA for 10 years, ex-PwC audit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
