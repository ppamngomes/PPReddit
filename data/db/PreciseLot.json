Some younger ones haven\u2019t seen 6 or 7 figures in a bank account and some older ones have that amount sitting in debt. I\u2019m not here to to give any financial or investment advice but if papa Cohen or Icahn are involved why the fuck would you sell these shares.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve thought about that situation a million times, the stock squeezes to 3-5 figures and I\u2019ve got a multimillion dollar position in a stock. Now what?</p>\n\n<p>Do I sell? Then\u2026. Buy a nice house and invest the money\u2026 into what? S&amp;P500?</p>\n\n<p>Why would I do that when I\u2019ve got a perfectly good company right here that\u2019s completely against corruption and looks after its shareholders. The investment is done. RC is all about long term investment &amp; growth, nothing about him says he\u2019s planning an overnight success and he\u2019s made that clear. Because of this I\u2019m 100% sure that whoever is holding this stock is not going to get fucked over.</p>\n\n<p>If he\u2019s involved and this pops we\u2019ll all see crazy numbers in our investment accounts but it\u2019s not a casino, you don\u2019t just cash out and that\u2019s you done. You\u2019ll need some sort of asset to generate income &amp; grow your funds over the years, that\u2019s either going to be a property portfolio, stock portfolio or a business.</p>\n\n<p>Business and property are good but when you\u2019re in them you\u2019re still just looking for somewhere to park your money and generate true passive income, once you cash out, that could be you unable to get back in at that price point. That genuinely scares me.</p>\n\n<p>For all I know we could all be fucked already and left for dead. But if the short destroyers are involved, I ain\u2019t fucking selling shit.</p>\n\n<p>Also PP and the boys are doing a great job. Really good energy in this sub.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
