We originally are from Philly. </p>\n\n<p>We are sitting here just chatting and I brought up the news about how I \u201clost\u201d all my shares. She doesn\u2019t know shit about the stock market let alone personal finance. She sat and watched a Tuesday hearing with Judge Papa back in June with me and likes when I explain things to her about the process because she feels like she is included with all us idiots. I always tell her I\u2019m gonna get \u201crich rich\u201d and force her into retirement.</p>\n\n<p>So we are sitting here and I expressed how it\u2019s a weird time, shares disappearing, and she was nervous I lost my money. I reassured her that was not the case. I told her RC, who she knows as the \u201cTeddy guy\u201d, is most likely involved at this point and I will know soon if I made life changing money. She laughed and she goes \u201cwell you know it\u2019s moments like these where you really appreciate what you have.\u201d I sat there, kinda paused, and started tearing up a bit because we never came from a lot. There were some moments where we didn\u2019t have shit so it brought me back and hit me like train in that quick instant. I looked at her and idk why but the Kelly Clarkson song, \u201cA Moment Like This\u201d, popped into my head. I started butchering it jokingly, she followed suit, and it just became one of those moments I will remember for the rest of my life.</p>\n\n<p>This experience has been a rollercoaster but if everything works out the way we all think it will then our lives are about to change drastically. While there is a lot of \u201cnoise\u201d right now, just remember why you are doing what you are doing. Appreciate your loved ones and don\u2019t sell for pennies so you can take care of them. NFA.</p>\n\n<p>Also this song is a banger in this situation so I thought I would share.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/S7b8ADhadJU?si=ozSnILwS9C0xQ9AZ\">https://youtu.be/S7b8ADhadJU?si=ozSnILwS9C0xQ9AZ</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Mods please adjust flair as you see fit.</p>\n\n<p>Hi, I\u2019m Crisptapwater. I have been involved in this crazy journey since Jan 21\u2019. You can catch me jumping around the sub talking shit and trying to encourage individuals to temper their expectations. I come from nothing. I have nothing besides my word, my balls, and my Bobby/Jimmy shares.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of negativity I have seen on the sub in the past 24 hours is actually fucking ridiculous. I\u2019m going to assume that the majority are shills trying to get their last licks in before we get an amended plan but it also seems that people aren\u2019t as unwavering in their conviction as it was previously stated.</p>\n\n<p>THIS PLAY HAS ALWAYS BEEN $0 OR LAMBOS.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about what that means. </p>\n\n<p>That means that this was and always has been a gamble. If you chose to purchase shares in Jan 2021 - September 2022 you did it off the basis that this stock was most likely a part of a basket of stocks that is heavily manipulated that could pop at any moment due to swaps going bust and volatility increasing not because they are the best retailer at selling wicker baskets. If you chose to purchase the stock from December 2022 - current times then you bought the stock off the basis that this company is going bankrupt and it\u2019s a huge risk to get involved but the payout of a potential turnaround could be life changing due to the amount of short volume at any given time.</p>\n\n<p>No one made YOU get involved knowing all of this information. No one made YOU hold until you were -99% on your investment. </p>\n\n<p>This is the gambit. This isn\u2019t Apple or Microsoft. This isn\u2019t Amazon or Google. This is fucking Bed Bath and mother fucking Beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we got that out of the way let\u2019s talk about the duration/length of this trade.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201dGetting to space was never going to be easy.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p>It took Michael Burry almost 5 years until he came out on top of his short position with sub-prime loans in 2008. The Big Short is one of my favorite movies because it doesn\u2019t show the protagonists spending their money after they won but because it showed the harsh reality of what they had to endure to be successful. The most important aspect of this saga isn\u2019t the money it\u2019s the transformation that everyone has gone thru and the knowledge you have acquired along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Idk what everyone else has been up to since Jan 21\u2019 but I\u2019ve been personally using this time to prepare for life after this trade. Money is just like alcohol and drugs. It\u2019s an amplifier. Since we already talked about this trade like it\u2019s playing the lottery let me explain that more than half of everyone involved will go broke after everything is said and done. You think you can manage millions of dollars but the funniest aspect is unless you are mentally and physically prepared for wealth you are going to fail long term. This game has always been designed this way. The frustrations many are showing now about \u201cit\u2019s tough to put food on the table\u201d are in for a rude awakening when they actually have the funds.</p>\n\n<p>I see many people, most being OG apes, say they are frustrated that \u201cit\u2019s taken so long\u201d to achieve what many will never achieve in their entire existence. \u201cWe have had to endure so much torment and being called a cultist from others because I chose to get involved.\u201d Respectfully imma need y\u2019all to STFU. One of the most freeing aspects of life is living it without recognizing others opinions.</p>\n\n<p>Let me say it again, people who aren\u2019t involved with this trade will never understand what the fuck is going on. This means trying to explain or justify your actions is a complete waste of fucking time. </p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s the polite way of saying it. My extremely transparent way of saying it is \u201cfuck your family, fuck your friends, fuck your co-workers, fuck MSM, fuck the analysts, fuck everyone on the internet that thinks they know otherwise.\u201d That is what we call unwavering conviction.</p>\n\n<p>If and when this works out the way it does, it\u2019s going to be in your best interest and yours alone. Just like it was your decision to get involved with this trade it\u2019s your decision who you choose to surround yourself with and who you choose to trust moving forward. One of the best things I\u2019ve learned about this voyage is I only wanna surround myself with people I am inspired by. </p>\n\n<p>Wanna know the kind of people I am inspired by? Some gentlemen named Ryan Cohen and Bill Pulte.</p>\n\n<p>RC buying in was never a reason to get involved. It was only a show of confidence that he saw value when others did not. RC is not a God or a King. He is an extremely bright, strategic businessman that we can all look up to and learn from. Just because he does something doesn\u2019t mean you should.</p>\n\n<p>Bill Pulte is another person I personally look up to and would like to associate with after this trade. He is successful and has plenty of money. Why would he choose to put himself in harms way of the law and get involved with the PP show? He already explained he doesn\u2019t hold BBBYQ. He is trying to inspire others whether that\u2019s thru philanthropy or just being a part of the show. The amount of negativity I have seen directed at Bill because expectations were high is utterly disgusting. He is not a God or a King. He is a human who is trying his best to help others with the situation he was given.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Final Days\u201d are here. I said everything I needed to say. Idgaf about karma or Reddit. I care about maintaining my health. I care about emotional and mental stability. I care about inspiring people to better themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Stay hydrated, get off the internet, go for a walk, touch some grass, find quan.</p>\n\n<p>This is the best time to be alive in human history.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck to everyone moving forward. I will see y\u2019all on the other side. \ud83e\udee1</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
