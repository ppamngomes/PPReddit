I have 750 shares of BBBYQ but they are stuck on WealthSimple (Canadian Broker) in my TFSA. What are my options at this point? Are the shares essentially gone? Or can I retrieve / transfer them to another broker/account? Has anyone experienced a similar situation? </p>\n\n<p>Thank you all in advance. I never expected this journey to take this long. I just want to know if there&#39;s still a chance for me to take action somehow? </p>\n\n<p>Peace \u270c\ufe0f</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
