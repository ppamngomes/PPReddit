Institutional/Insider holdings are less than 1 percent of the float now. Let that sink in. We hold the remaining 99%+ and absolutely dictate where this rocket goes.</p>\n\n<p>When we go live (hopefully backed on the Tzero decentralized system), computers will be RACING on overdrive to meet quotas in a desperate attempt to close short positions first. Us Bobbys hold shares that are well in excess of the TSO, plausibly to the tune of billions of shares. Shorts will be seeking any bids that are on the books, and the lowest bids will fill first. </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I will be setting my bids VERY HIGH. I&#39;d like to ask if you are fond of the idea of getting $1,000 a piece for any of your shares or more? Well guess what, if the lowest bids on the order sheet starts at $1,000 that\u2019s the fucking floor. The shorts are trapped in here with us, and we hold the keys.</p>\n\n<p>Plan ahead for when our new shares go live and realize that this IS going to be a true Short Squeeze\u2026 <strong>Likely the Mother Of All Short Squeezes.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Do any of you remember fractional shares selling during the GME sneeze at astronomical levels? This happened precisely because in that moment, those orders were the cheapest/only ones available and the computers were told to fill the lowest bids because their overlords needed shares. </p>\n\n<p>Ex\u2026. A Robinhood user was able to sell a single fractional share (equivalent of 0.196039 of a share) for $2,605.50. That would equate to $13,290.72 per share. Really... let that sink in.</p>\n\n<p>The GME Sneeze was due to volatility in the options chain and the surge of retail FOMO. For a while people were calling it as a short squeeze, but we all know the shorts were never forced to close and cheated their way out of those obligations by turning off the buy button, so that never took place. What IS about to happen will be equivalent to RC reacting to the sneeze and saying\u2026.\u201d Oh, you want an actual Short Squeeze? Hold my fucking beer!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Again, </p>\n\n<h1>We. Are. The. MOASS!!!!!!!</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

We&#39;ve made it to the launch pad!</p>\n\n<p>I was just reaching for my checklist/plan post-launch and realized I don&#39;t actually have one, ha!  My exit strategy at current is basically just a MASSIVE parabola with an intercept of zero, and a bunch of random points where I sell incrementally more shares.  Still I wonder... how high will this bitch actually run?</p>\n\n<h1>So tell me, what methods are you guys using to apply statistics and correlations against other stocks that have squeezed, or whatever mechanics you see possible? I&#39;d love to get insight into what valuations you guys are considering and how to navigate the MOASS!</h1>\n\n<p>Obviously everyone has their own plans and opinions. Major questions include: will we be on blockchain and/or the existing exchanges; how big of a play truly is this; how do you even guess what part of the solar system/universe we&#39;ll land at if this truly is unprecedented, etc? I personally couldn&#39;t be more excited, and have at least considered how to safely play this assuming some force will try to kneecap us along the way.  Still, there must be some way to pave a more educated path forward... </p>\n\n<p>For example... I&#39;m going to look into the Spearman&#39;s Rank correlation coefficient, and see what else the fuck I can find, but I honestly have no idea how to do this. I&#39;m tired at the moment trying to consider the the power of this squeeze based on how heavily shorted our beloved is, what the market cap may be, TSO, etc. </p>\n\n<p>All I know is that the higher it goes the more I sell, and no I&#39;m not sharing my price targets or holdings, but you better believe that I have a very high floor, and am saving a <strong>healthy</strong> percentage of my shares for the infinity squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc8e</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
