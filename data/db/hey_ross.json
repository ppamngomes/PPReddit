See this for more, but given the worries about links, text below.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t Get Cute with the Court: Filing \u201cDraft\u201d Plan During Debtor\u2019s Exclusive Period Can Cost You, No Matter What You Call It.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mess around with [exclusivity]\u201d \u2013 Lil\u2019 Kim (as revised)</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve posted before on the contours of a chapter 11 debtor\u2019s exclusive period within which to propose a plan of reorganization, and on just what might not constitute impermissible solicitation prior to approval of a disclosure statement.  The Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts has now reminded us of the sacrosanct nature of the debtor\u2019s exclusivity period, warning against any improper attempts to interfere with a debtor\u2019s initial right to control its chapter 11 case.</p>\n\n<p>Section 1121(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides debtors with an exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization for 120 days after the commencement of a chapter 11 case.  Though this \u201cexclusivity period\u201d is subject to extension or termination, it is automatic and inviolate unless and until the bankruptcy court orders otherwise.  Hand in hand with section 1121(b), section 1125(b) of the Bankruptcy Code prohibits solicitation of the acceptance or rejection of a plan of reorganization in the absence of a court-approved disclosure statement.  In turn, section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that \u201cthe court may designate any entity whose acceptance or rejection of such plan [i] was not in good faith, or [ii] was not solicited or procured [a] in good faith or [b] in accordance with the provisions of this title.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In re Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church of Boston, the debtor commenced a chapter 11 case and, on the same day, proposed a plan of reorganization.  That plan proposed to pay OneUnited Bank (the debtor\u2019s major secured creditor) in full over time, with no recoveries for general unsecured creditors.  OneUnited, unhappy with that plan, moved to terminate exclusivity, attaching an unsigned \u201cDRAFT\u201d plan of reorganization of its own.  In its motion, OneUnited noted that this alternative plan would pay unsecured creditors in full, subject to a cash contribution from the First Episcopal District of the African Methodist Church (which was not a debtor in the church\u2019s chapter 11 case).  OneUnited served the motion (without attachments) on seventeen of the church\u2019s creditors, which constituted more than half of the debtor\u2019s general unsecured creditors by number.  Even though the draft plan was not attached, OneUnited promised to circulate copies of the attachments on request.  Moreover, the complete motion (with attachments) was filed on the court\u2019s public docket in the church\u2019s chapter 11 case.  In response, the debtor-church filed a motion to equitably subordinate OneUnited\u2019s claim, to designate the votes of OneUnited, and for the award of its attorneys\u2019 fees from OneUnited.</p>\n\n<p>The bankruptcy court saw right through OneUnited\u2019s clever attempt to dissuade creditors from accepting the debtor\u2019s plan.  As the bankruptcy court concluded, OneUnited\u2019s draft plan \u201ccould not possibly have been confirmed\u201d because it depended entirely on a large cash contribution from a non-debtor that had no present obligation to fund the plan.  The court further noted that OneUnited was well aware of this \u201cinfirmity,\u201d and that the motion and draft plan were all part of an effort undertaken \u201cfor [no] purpose other than to sway the votes of unsecured creditors with a false hope of payment in full. . . .\u201d  In other words, the OneUnited \u201cplan\u201d was not a true exit strategy \u2013 instead, it was a ruse to attempt to rally the debtor\u2019s creditors against the debtor\u2019s initial plan.</p>\n\n<p>In considering the debtor\u2019s motion, the bankruptcy court followed a previous non-binding decision from the same court, in which the court held that creditors who had filed and circulated a plan and disclosure statement prior to the termination of exclusivity period had violated both section 1121(b) and 1125(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.  In this case, the bankruptcy court noted that it was irrelevant that OneUnited had not actually filed a plan or a disclosure statement in their own right and that only two creditors had actually been served with OneUnited\u2019s plan \u2013 the fact remained that OneUnited had \u201cfiled\u201d a \u201cplan\u201d during the exclusivity period.  Regardless of who would have actually seen the draft plan, \u201c[t]he filing of a document puts it on the public record . . . supplying actual notice to any who care to look at it.\u201d  Moreover, the court noted that section 1121(b) is \u201ca rule against filing\u201d (emphasis in original).  Accordingly, the court could not countenance \u201cthe possibilities for mischief\u201d in filing competing plans under the guise of otherwise permissible motions.  And while the court did not conclude whether the filing and service of the exclusivity termination motion constituted an impermissible solicitation, it noted that the question was merely \u201cacademic\u201d because OneUnited had clearly infringed upon the debtor\u2019s exclusive period to file a plan, and, at a minimum, must be penalized for this misconduct.</p>\n\n<p>Though the court declined to subordinate OneUnited\u2019s claim, deeming such a remedy disproportionate to the harm (after all, it held a secured claim much larger than any other claims in the case), it fashioned a proper remedy, based on the specific facts of the case.  First, the court prohibited OneUnited from proposing any plan (a directive that the court said it would not have ordered had OneUnited been able to actually benefit the church\u2019s estate via an alternative plan).  Second, the court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses for the church\u2019s counsel, at its regularly hourly rates (notwithstanding the fact that counsel was serving pro bono) for the work undertaken in connection with the church\u2019s motion and held that OneUnited would not be entitled to payment of attorneys\u2019 fees in connection with its exclusivity motion and defending against the debtor\u2019s motion.  Third, because the court found these first two remedies to be \u201cinadequate to the offense\u201d (i.e., OneUnited\u2019s \u201cknowing and deliberate violation of the right of exclusivity . . . made only the more egregious by the falsity of the hope and pretense of the ploy\u201d), the court required OneUnited to fund the cost of the examiner to be appointed in the debtor\u2019s chapter 11 case (subject to a $50,000 cap).</p>\n\n<p>The bankruptcy court would not go so far as to subordinate OneUnited\u2019s secured debt, but its harsh critique of OneUnited\u2019s tactics serve as an uncompromising warning not to play games with a debtor\u2019s exclusive right to manage its affairs in the first months of a chapter 11 case.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83e\udd88 Megladon \ud83e\udd88 ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I went to a private school in West Palm Beach, where most of my peers in the school had parents with white collar finance jobs.</p>\n\n<p>As a parallel, just south of me by 15 miles, was a guy a year younger than me growing up in this same toxic stew of &#39;money for money&#39;s sake&#39; - Ken C. Griffin.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s hard to relate now what the culture was like from 1980-1987 in south Florida but consider the cultural vibe - massive influx from the Mariel boatlift out of Cuba resulted in major criminal figures from the Cuban prison system setting up shop in Miami, running drug operations and tearing through Miami Shores neighborhoods in high-speed chases.  Small businesses were constantly being burgled, criminals trying to launder money through cash businesses led to weird things, like there being no legitimate laundromats in Overtown for several years. On television, Crockett and Tubbs were out fighting crime and Gordon Gekko was in the movies.  Greed, avarice, self-interest and &#39;I&#39;ll get mine&quot; were the vibe of the day, complete with white suits for the evening once you took off the Armani.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is I clearly remember a lot of my peers, who had dads in Finance, talking about starting a career in finance, but their language was all wrong - it was about bond trading, arbitrage, derivatives on volatile stocks, etc.  It was the beginning of the financialization of the economy - money moving for the sake of money.</p>\n\n<p>This started with good intent - options, derivatives, swaps, etc. were all meant to hedge risk from disruption while real capital formation was about starting a business that created value.  But a thought was in the back of the mind of these 80&#39;s kids from their dads and role models and it came out of the rise of Las Vegas in the 1970&#39;s - the House Always Wins.  With the rise of financialization, the financial sector shifted, slowly at first, from a sector that existed of the transactional margins of a deal designed to help businesses grow by accessing capital to a sector that realized that the gambling on these hedging instruments was far more profitable.  Buy and hold, the advice of ages, became a problem - the casino doesn&#39;t make its money off the sports book bettor who comes in early May with a bet on the Seahawks to win the Superbowl next January, it makes its money off the person sitting nonstop at the slot machine or the table.  In other words, we stopped operating the financial sector for the purpose of raising capital, but for the purpose of betting on capital market participants.</p>\n\n<p>This mental shift is profound.  Prior to this, trades existed in one mindset - someone who thinks a particular company is going to grow faster than the market thinks (buyer) and someone who thinks a company is going to grow slower than the market thinks (seller), so the seller sells their stock to the buyer, who then holds it to see how the thesis plays out.</p>\n\n<p>Now we have a situation where you can not only bet on growth, but options and derivatives operate on the notion on extreme movement.  So, the bet isn&#39;t slow or fast growth relative to expectations, its now binary - success or failure.  This shows up in things besides cellar boxed stocks - binary options, 0DTE options, etc. are all bets on an outcome, not investment in a company.</p>\n\n<p>The % of income Wall Street market makers earn from Financialization as a % of GDP is completely out of control.  Cash is flowing to the casino; not main street and it shows.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not that guy.  What I saw in Florida in the 1980&#39;s was a moment that disgusted me, not excited me.  These idiots were excited about the movement of money, but I was witnessing the rise of computers and how they would generate new forms of value.  I cannot begin to express how weird this was - I was one of three kids in 1980 I knew spending every moment reading coding books and trying new PEEK/POKE registers to see what would happen, while my peers were reading their Dad&#39;s Wall Street Journal.  I saw that this tool wouldn&#39;t be a new filing cabinet, but early BBS&#39;s like Mustang and other services showed it would be how the world connects and interacts and eventually, conducts business.</p>\n\n<p>I went away from finance - I think it&#39;s a corrosive influence on our society and on us as individuals if we start moving too far away from value.  As I&#39;ve said repeatedly, this play on Butterfly baskets is a bet - there isn&#39;t enough information to make it an investment.  But I think it&#39;s a reasonable bet for an unreasonable outcome, so I&#39;m playing it.</p>\n\n<p>What will I do with the money?  Same thing I do with money now - create businesses and invest capital.  Outside my day job at Oracle, I&#39;ve been the seed investor in 2 tech companies, 5 hospitality businesses and a manufacturer, but in the past I&#39;ve started over 15 companies, several of which went on to acquisition.  Job creation at the core is value creation and capitalism are way more fun if you play it as an Infinite game, where the goal is to get more players on the field and to create more value for others faster, not a Finite game where the goal is to win and eliminate the other players. I&#39;m done with tolerating parasites masquerading as a real part of our economy.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m here for the Infinite game. Play your own infinite game with others or on your own, but let&#39;s get everyone on the field.</p>\n\n<p>For those unfamilar with this concept, I highly encourage reading James P. Carse&#39;s book on this topic.   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games#:%7E:text=A%20finite%20game%20is%20played,and%20announce%20winners%20and%20losers.\">Finite and Infinite Games - Wikipedia</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83e\udd88 Megladon \ud83e\udd88 ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

AST financial is privately held and a rapid adopter of technology, as noted here:  <a href=\"https://www.astfinancial.com/about-us\">https://www.astfinancial.com/about-us</a></p>\n\n<p>So, who own&#39;s AST?  It&#39;s owned by Equiniti, a PE-backed firm that was a rollup of firms by Siris Capital back in 2020.  PE firms invest in rollups when they think they can either create innovation between the companies or that the companies are likely to create a sum greater than the parts by coming together, then selling the entity.  I can see they are investing in several elements that would be critical to a functioning marketplace for a tokenized stock platform - private company issue management (2018), Proxy automation for shareholder votes (2019) and Astrella, a stock platform for private companies.</p>\n\n<p>What they are missing is a marketplace with transparent bid/ask pricing and ownership transfer management in that marketplace.  That&#39;s what it looks like Loopring and GME are building based on the Github code. </p>\n\n<p>So, my speculative brain fits the pieces together like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>GMErica, Inc. acquires Equiniti to own the share registry platform and the private company platform</li>\n<li>BBBY, as one of the only retailers issues by AST as a share registry, agrees to move shares to the NFT platform integrated in the GME nft marketplace</li>\n<li>BBBY recalls shares as GME recalls shares to move to the new marketplace.  This takes away the criticism of the nft marketplace not being a real market for stocks as it only has GME in the marketplace</li>\n<li>BBBY squeezes like a mofo as does GME, causing other firms to want to move to nft stock trading</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s essential that the stock marketplace cannot be the home to just one company and I think BBBY is a candidate and as a result, either GME is going to buy Equiniti in a private transaction or Siris Capital is about to own one of the most valuable platforms in history.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR BBBY isn&#39;t a distraction for GME, it&#39;s the first company other than GME to tokenize shares to blockchain in the nft marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>Edit over a year later: I now believe RC ventures will acquire EQ and then acquire a collection of cellar boxed companies for Teddy with shares issued on a blockchain marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>I think GameStop wallet had to die for this to work legally with the new SEC rules on crypto securities like Ripple</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83e\udd88 Megladon \ud83e\udd88 ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
