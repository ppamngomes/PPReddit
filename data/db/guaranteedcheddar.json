Oopsiedaisy.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Judge Papalia would say &quot;Whoops, I guess I shouldn&#39;t have approved those thousands of hours of legal fees incurred by the attorneys related to M&amp;A and effort unrelated to liquidation.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The attorneys, Holly Etlin, and David Kastin would say &quot;I guess we shouldn&#39;t have tied our reputations to this legal debacle and fleecing of investors. Time to hire some attorneys for ourselves.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Everyone with an NDA would say &quot;Yeah, we didn&#39;t really have anything to hide.&quot; Same goes for the hundreds of hours spent scrubbing Kroll documents: &quot;All good here. There was nothing to see here, we&#39;re just creating some work for our interns.&quot; Judge Papalia? &quot;No comment.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Sue Gove would say &quot;Yeah, some of you on GME Meltdown were right - that was a tone-deaf and incredibly ill-timed interview. I knew we were going to be going through bankruptcy the next week, and I just forgot. Or I didn&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t matter, either way it was a massive oversight. Time for retirement, see ya later suckers!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Bill Pulte would say &quot;I was just having fun when I had the PPShow people at my home office and dressed up in a space suit. What teddy bear?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Ryan Cohen would say &quot;I guess I should have let the community know that I was out of the trade. I didn&#39;t really want Buy Buy Baby in the end, even though I wrote a highly publicized letter saying just that, invested more in BBBY then I ever did in GameStop, then put my people on the board of directors, and could have bought the company in bankruptcy for a song. My delight-the-customer approach I used at Chewy would have made life-long customers at Buy Buy Baby. I know that short sellers are driving down the value of GameStop, and that finally putting a stop to their business-killing methods could be possible by putting a heavily-shorted stock on the blockchain. This would save my business, save other businesses, reset the market, and reward the investors who I have grown to appreciate. It would be a true David vs Goliath story that I could actually help make happen. Naaaaah.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He&#39;d add, &quot;Oh and children&#39;s books are a passion of mine, what can I say?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>You get the idea.

She returned and said that Mainstar&#39;s corporate action department hasn&#39;t received anything. However, she said that their understanding is that a mailing was sent to the client directly, and not to the custodian. She had no awareness of when said letter was sent, but asked me if I had received anything. And then she referred me to the Kroll website, natch.</p>\n\n<p>I asked if she had seen this sort of thing before, and she said &quot;not with a common stock, only with a special asset.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She said she thinks there are a lot of investors of the stock that would be watching this closely, and offered &quot;I think we&#39;re at the very beginning of it.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "TRUST ME BRO", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ea0027"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I agree, the fact that there is much more to come is exciting. Now check this one out:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/een26cflgaib1.jpg?width=539&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1457aa580a78fa1a07a72e5358c44175d34e829b\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/een26cflgaib1.jpg?width=539&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1457aa580a78fa1a07a72e5358c44175d34e829b\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/een26cflgaib1.jpg?width=539&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1457aa580a78fa1a07a72e5358c44175d34e829b\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I hope she&#39;s right. She&#39;s not the only one ready for the next chapter. And, &quot;a lot sooner than I thought&quot; sounds... soon. I thought these were some interesting notes as well: </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/l74ik2yrgaib1.jpg?width=550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff4a453857c63e912a57881d90dbb22121f86b32\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/l74ik2yrgaib1.jpg?width=550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff4a453857c63e912a57881d90dbb22121f86b32\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/l74ik2yrgaib1.jpg?width=550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff4a453857c63e912a57881d90dbb22121f86b32\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Building Buy Buy up to what it was, but better? That&#39;s a pretty tall order, but I like her optimism. And I&#39;m excited to see the new site too. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, there are a couple of additional hires from yesterday which I haven&#39;t seen noted:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cjkfscvmiaib1.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e0f19ffcc2a5bc47c233f35f0d608a1ede347e4\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/cjkfscvmiaib1.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e0f19ffcc2a5bc47c233f35f0d608a1ede347e4\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/cjkfscvmiaib1.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e0f19ffcc2a5bc47c233f35f0d608a1ede347e4\"></a></p>\n\n<p>IMHO, this new company has plans in place for which these hires aren&#39;t allowed to speak. This company has</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a different name</li>\n<li>an omnichannel structure</li>\n<li>fiscal backing</li>\n<li>an exciting upcoming website</li>\n<li>high-level, experienced executive team</li>\n<li>a physical NY/NJ presence</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For those shills who say this has nothing to do with BBBY, I submit that this has everything to do with our investment. The thesis from way back was that Ryan Cohen wanted this company, and it would be acquired via reverse merger. I don&#39;t think this has changed. I think that Ryan is transforming this business into a new hybrid online/in-store experience.  He&#39;s keeping and hiring key employees familiar with the inner workings, who work with a chip on their shoulder. He&#39;s developed a new website which showcases products like never before. And from the sounds of it, all will be revealed soon. I&#39;m excited to be a shareholder. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/sA5K3lAdLKKv3YwsXYF_ZNF7syOdBF0unDkbprqv_50.jpg\"/></div>"},

I know I&#39;m not the only one that values his opinion. I understand that the space meeting was unrecorded, but I took some notes and thought I would pass them on:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Regarding Document 1538 - there is a letter from Deloitte in there, which talks about retaining them for three kinds of services (taxes etc) through 2026. I looked at the rates they are charging, and they are competitive. Normally you don&#39;t retain a company this long during bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, the document is boilerplate, but on page 132, RC is noted as a party of interest. I expect that we won&#39;t find out the play until the last moment, and they are trying to keep their plans as secretive as possible.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The scope of service provides more detail. The evidence is that they aren&#39;t shutting down. There are two new acquisition companies. I phoned them, and they are in good standing.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Everything is looking great.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The LinkedIn thing, with the layoffs? That happens all the time. I&#39;m bullish about IT layoffs. Thought it would be more. Don&#39;t worry about IT stuff. They&#39;ll likely use the same ERP as Gamestop, SAP.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I haven&#39;t seen anything bearish.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The company is NOT getting liquidated. There have been a couple of acquisition companies revealed. I&#39;m not buying the Dream on Me angle. I&#39;m looking at facts.
