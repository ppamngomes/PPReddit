However, I have started listening recently because r / bbby is getting a lot of new users/posters and it\u2019s hard to know who is legit.. At least with the show and because I have been in the play for a while, I know you guys have been involved/posting/providing content for a while on bbby, and thus your agendas verifiable to some degree (it\u2019s the internet at the end of the day \ud83d\ude02) I value your thoughts and views.</p>\n\n<p>All the above being said, I don\u2019t know the full back story to the beef with the guy Mirandz (can\u2019t even spell his name because I don\u2019t view his content) but if you guys listen back, he was providing views and wanted to have a conversation but it seemed like you guys didn\u2019t want to have one. After listening you guys just were pushing him back with responses like \u201cwhy do you hate the company\u201d / \u201cwhy do you want ppl to lose their jobs\u201d / \u201ccome back to me in writing\u201d (real eyes \ud83d\udc40) etc.. It\u2019s just if we don\u2019t want the communities to be echo chambers we need to be able to discuss and debate alternative views. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I just thought it was unfortunate because there was a good debate to be had there and topics to provide conflicting views on but instead it seemed like it was a bit gang mentality and unwillingness to discuss alternative views.. would be good if you guys thought about getting him on and having a controlled conversation with everyone  (agree topics to talk about ahead of the show so everyone can be prepared, just like in a work setting because I understand it can get heated\ud83d\ude02)</p>\n\n<p>Also I think everyone was focusing on defending ABC and he actually was the one that cared least about any mocking/joking and the only one out of the regular crew that actually wanted to have a productive conversation (along with Mirandz).. props to ABC</p>\n\n<p>Anyway might get hate for this but just wanted to post this because I think there is good value to having to hear what the guy has to say and if the agenda is sorted ahead people can retort and it will be a great show \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb</p>\n\n<p>The guy did go a bit too far with the photo but he apologised to him and spoke to him with respect (I think there is an element of everyone slagging each other)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway peace and al that jazz \u270c\ufe0f</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
