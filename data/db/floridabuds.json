How did you all interpret that? Was the $895 million that went into treasury before or after the ABL paydown?</p>\n\n<p><strong>If before the ABL paydown, there is roughly $90,300,000 for bondholders and other general unsecured claims to be paid out.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>If after the ABL paydown, there is roughly $290,300,000 for bondholders and other general unsecured claims to be paid out.</strong></p>\n\n<p>How much are bondholders expected to get according to you guys? Maybe there is an opportunity to secure all the bonds (since those will be paid back above current prices) and argue for business continuation that includes shareholders. Looks like only the bondholders are a big enough group that can vote against the current plan- why don&#39;t we become that voting block? Shareholders can&#39;t vote, only opt-out... After, we can get Pulte to work with us and license Teddy from RC and use the NOLs?</p>\n\n<p>We likely already control the float. Maybe 2x the float. We don&#39;t need to buy more shares if it&#39;s already locked up. What&#39;s needed is for shares to continue with a new company and if buying bonds worth just 10 million in total right now can help do that, I think it should be discussed.</p>\n\n<p>Icahn has bought a company&#39;s bonds after they went bankrupt to gain control, right? Maybe we should take a page from his book...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/cM2R4NOC6xM2hEcOcIOmpM61NeNNZ5qMXdAgrsajEJA.jpg\"/></div>"},
