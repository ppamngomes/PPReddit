Momma and our new baby girl are healthy and doing well! The past 30+ hours were a living hell though and I\u2019m finally about to get some rest. Momma wanted to labor naturally and made it 3 hours before asking for an epidural, then the anesthesiologist couldn\u2019t make it for another 2.5 hours dues to other surgeries, then she got to labor comfortably for another 4 hours before the baby was being stubborn and wasn\u2019t coming out so we had to resort to a c-section because her water broke 15 hours earlier and they were both feverish and at risk for infection. Then when they finally extracted to poor thing they found her tangled up in her umbilical cord. Jesus Christ like I can not fucking make this shit up! All in all my wife proved to me she is a fucking beast of a human and gave it her all to save our child. In return I\u2019m holding this shit until hedges are fukt and crying for shares like I cried for my daughter and wife\u2019s lives in the OR until I knew they were safe.

I became super bullish on this stock after I learned pretty quickly that babies are recession proof. I went from being extremely frugal to dumping every penny into baby stuff. I feel like we are in the final stages of this play and hope this shit takes off while I\u2019m on paternity leave so we won\u2019t have to worry about money anymore. I\u2019m too karma poor to post on the BBBY subreddit but I\u2019m soo grateful for this community!
