It is increasing by hours every day, more and more shills are shitting on us, more and more bots want us to sell... It feels like without a plan you can easily be overwhelmed with everything going on and accidentally close your positions....</p>\n\n<p>Most of the holders are now probably waiting for BK squeeze, if that will occur we are probably looking around 2$ as Roach has already mentioned in one of the past streams... This is where most of the paperhands will jump in to close their positions to minimize their losses or to make some $$ if their average is lower.. Not shaming anyone, you have to do what is best for you.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking.. but what&#39;s the plan if you consider yourself diamondhand. Going to zero is not a plan, it&#39;s more like a plan C where you don&#39;t need to do anything.. But if BBBY will squeeze, I mean proper squeeze and you will still be holding a bag. What&#39;s your plan, where do you say it&#39;s enough for me, the stock price seems fair now and nakeds are fucked enough to learn the lesson? Not looking for a financial advise and nothing I say should be considered one.. obviously</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This is how I (completely regarded person) decided on the take profit range in case of a proper squeeze:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The pressure used to make paper is typically measured in pounds per linear inch (PLI) or megapascals (MPa), with a range of around 200-800 PLI or 1.4-5.5 MPa.  </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the pressure used to make diamonds through high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) synthesis is much higher, measured in gigapascals (GPa) or pounds per square inch (psi), with a range of around 5-7 GPa or roughly 725,000-1,015,000 psi.  </p>\n\n<p>To compare these units of pressure, 1 gigapascal is equal to 145,037.74 psi, so the pressure used to make diamonds is roughly 50,000-70,000 times higher than the pressure used to make paper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The paperhand baseline sell ceiling is most probably $2 if we are lucky enough. So to become a real diamondhand I need to be true to myself and start selling only when the price of the stock reaches 2$ (paperhand baseline) * 50k (diamond coefficient) = $100k for a single stock. </p>\n\n<p>Yes, it&#39;s regarded, but it&#39;s me and it&#39;s my way to deal with it. If it was GME everyone would say fair play, but what do you dear regards think, what is your plan in case we see a proper squeeze?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I&#39;m  buying as long as IB will allow me to buy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff4500"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
