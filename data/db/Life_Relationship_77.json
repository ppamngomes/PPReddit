Pete\\_the\\_pilot and William have been claiming on the show that the Preferred Shares have been converted and Common Share Warrants have been exercised into Common Shares, thereby causing dilution in the float, citing the increased Outstanding Shares number reported in recent Preliminary Proxy Statement SEC filing. However, as I explained in point 6, in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/11wgcti/state_of_the_play_bbby_poised_for_takeoff/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) that cannot be the case, as we have not seen any 8K SEC filings reporting those material events. Pete has even been citing the after hours price drop, last Friday, as evidence that HBC has been dumping their Common Shares. Again, the data doesn't support this, as explained in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/11wdsur/trading_data_shows_that_after_hours_price_drop_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) where the data shows that price drop was caused by a short attack that was trying to mimic dilution. Also, the other thing that is being stated on the show is that BBBY stock price ran up yesterday because GME ran up, citing a possible meme basket theory. But, the data again doesn't support that as well, as explained in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/11ydijo/what_caused_bbby_to_rip_yesterday_032123/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), where the data shows that BBBY ran up because of a flurry of call options exercises and/or delta hedging, 20 minutes before market close, when coincidentally shorts also ran out of available shares to borrow. If BBBY ran-up just because GME ran up yesterday, why did it not run up the entire day, like GME did yesterday and why is it not running up like GME is today?\n\n**Edit:** I am adding my response to u/Finallytherenow's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/11ypp60/comment/jd97i65/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) below, as Reddit won't let me post that as a comment, since it is too long.\n\nThe convertible preferred shares cannot be converted at below $6.15 conversion price, unless there is a triggering event (and data shows that there has been one) and a  **\u201cRequired Premium of the Conversion Amount\u201d**  of 115% of the regular Conversion Amount of $10,000 per Preferred Share is paid by the Holder(s) who chose the Alternate Conversion option. So, that material event would require an 8K SEC filing and we have not seen any such filing, which implies that the conversion has not occurred yet. Check out below the snippets from various SEC filings and publicly available data from where I am arriving at the above conclusion.\n\nFrom Page 1 of  [424b5 Prospectus Supplement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000119312523030356/d406368d424b5.htm):\n\n>The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of common stock at a fixed conversion price of $6.15 per common share (the \u201cConversion Price\u201d).

This was previously discussed in this [WSB post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wrt365/start_tomorrows_bbby_face_ripper_by_calling_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). The call options ask price + the strike price of the current deep ITM calls are currently pretty close to current market price, as can be seen in the [options chain](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/options). The tax implications of this strategy are also no different than buying the stock at the market price, as the option premium price is added to the strike price to form the cost basis (which is pretty close to the market price) for tax calculation purposes, as described in this [article](https://www.moneyshow.com/articles/optionsidea-42816/tax-treatment-for-call-and-put-options/). IMHO, this may be a strategy that can be used to avoid the price suppression via naked shorting that we are all experiencing, right now?
