I want to thank PP, ABC,and the entire brain trust for all you do. I have been following since I bought in @ $10 in August of last year.  I want to thank them all for their never ending commitment to keeping us informed and entertained. I dont have the analytical skills of the regulars on the show, but what I can do is possibly add some entertainment value. I wrote a couple tunes for this enigma known as the PP show. Please enjoy the following links that are my contribution to the PPshow to pay omage to the creator and his round table. </p>\n\n<p>I am not in this for plays or clicks as my original music is not attached or linked. This is all for the PP show and the community!!!!

I myself am a bbby holder and feel happy he is encouraging us. My goal as an, &quot;Activist investor&quot;, is to slow life down, but to also help others to do the same thing. Time is the only  commodity that large corporate entities cant buy, and our hodling breaks their playbook in half. I personally hate that corporate America uses the market, to slowly fleace the American middle class. I think Mr. Pulte is a kind person that I hope Im hodling with. Not because he is a millionaire, because he his a stand up guy like me, and wants to make a difference. Just like me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff4500"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
