He\u2019s already gotten the type of exposure you\u2019d like to avoid in that case. Or maybe you think he would like to take from retail, much of which is likely lower-middle class, just because he could? </p>\n\n<p>Again, it is downright impossible for him to not see some of the tinfoil on social media - the way he gets tagged on Twitter - why would you feed into that with unnecessarily vague tweeting or giving an interview? (with an objectively awkward interviewer, sorry). </p>\n\n<p>To summarize, you either think he is a dickhead grifter &amp; stupid, or just stupid. </p>\n\n<p>But why do either of those things even matter? \nBecause he sees exactly what we see. \nIf someone wants to white night this then someone big, who has been working through unethical(at best) loopholes and shorting tactics, while the board stands (potentially) idle, will be paying for this squeeze. </p>\n\n<p>To be clear, it\u2019s happening with or without us. He has the capital to make it happen. And knows the legal limitations of what he can say. </p>\n\n<p>RC is okay with that because, I presume, he believes himself capable of quickly taking the business and the capital generated in a more ethical, profitable direction while delighting customers and shareholders in the process. It\u2019s not hippy-dippy, fairy dust or imaginative thinking\u2026 it\u2019s, quite literally, what he espouses. All of the times he speaks. </p>\n\n<p>The evidence is obvious.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re on the rocket</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "", "text_color": "", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
