This is important because it is this internalization / inventory fulfillment which keeps trades from hitting the public exchanges and moving the NBBO. It is not typically until a market maker runs out of internal inventory of a stock AND runs out of known locates to naked short AND still faces buy-side pressure that they will resort to open market arbitrage in order to fulfill those buy orders.</p>\n\n<p>Therein lies the limit to how much market makers can legally (and sensibly) naked short, which is the number of shares they can vouch to be potentially obtainable, or known locates. Known locates however have devolved into (or maybe always have been) simply the number of shares outstanding minus the shares held in book entry under shareholder names that are not Cede and Co. Until they hit that limit though, there is nothing stopping them from fulfilling orders using naked shorted shares and kicking the can on delivery for a time arbitrage opportunity. Combine the delayed settlement with coordinated hit pieces, astroturfed social media sentiment, and a flimsy low-liquidity small cap stock, and buying on the open market in order to fulfill becomes less profitable than taking on the risk of longer-term (and artificially created) time arbitrage opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Brokers are entitled to loan your shares out for non-naked shorting if they are held in margin accounts or if you opt in to a share lending program, but simply holding any beneficial street name shares through the DTC guarantees their availability as a known locate, and thus for naked shorting for market making. DRSing those Bobbies in your name guarantees they are not available as potential borrows or as known locates.</p>\n\n<p>However, even registered shares held in a company&#39;s dividend reinvestment DRIP plan, but not book entry, are still made available to the DTC&#39;s pool of known locates for bonafide market makers.

However, because of the quant HFT nature with which market makers operate, it would surprise me if the aggregate number of fails across the entire window ever added up to more than the total shares available in the known locate pool (Cede and Co registered shares). The role of tokenized shares further opens the Pandora&#39;s box of fraudulent known locates, but with the downfall of FTX, that too seems to me to be an emerging and precarious bandaid mechanism reserved for acute liquidity emergencies.</p>\n\n<p>FTDs are THE ultimate mechanism by which the NBBO is manipulated (by way of forced derivative delta hedging and selective exchange routing), so limiting the available pool of known locates would directly affect the mechanism by which naked shorting is justified. The business model relies on replenishing inventory for cheaper than the price sold in order to recycle the deadline of forced delivery. Removing known locates from the DTC pool helps remove the risk-free sell-side naked short pressure and prevent market makers from flooding the open market with sell orders and from reloading their retail inventory as cheaply as they would otherwise. This is a compounding effect based on the profitability of that sell-buy spread that market makers are constantly arbitraging.</p>\n\n<p>For DRS though, the effect of removing liquidity from the fraud fairy is multiplied thanks to the rehypothecation of short sales (naked and regular) due to lax and false adherence to short reporting requirements. The only indications of whether shares bought through a brokerage are long or short sales is self-reported, and we all know how well self-enforcement works on wall street. Conceivably, without accurate 3rd party reporting, the same shares can be sold short into the market multiple times over by different brokerages who are none-the-wiser about where those shares came from. The share lending market along with PFOF has become the central mechanism of the new brokerage business model. It is rife with conflicts of interest and opaque enough to create plausible deniability in enforcement cases.
