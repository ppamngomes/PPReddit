After Bill Pulte&#39;s question in the live space tonight I wanted to offer some thoughts on GME.</p>\n\n<p>GME&#39;s main business is used game sales and I think the most logical expansion for them is to expand into digital sales.</p>\n\n<p>Getting game companies to go along with resale of digital licenses is something that would require a certain scale in order for them to invest in any one system that would need to be implemented into their games. This means there are only a handful of competitors with the size to make something like this to happen.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to do this would be using NFTs that are tied to your game license and can be resold through the GME market. By tieing an NFT to the license would also increase the value of the individual license keys, helping adoption by users and could even be used to give in game rewards as others have mentioned. Giving a small royalty of every game sale to the game developer could work as an additional incentive for developers to go along with this over forcing people to buy a new license.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to offer resale of digital licenses would give GME a HUGE advantage over Stream and Epic game stores, making them not just another game launcher and bring a legitimate use case for NFT/blockchain technology. In my opinion this would be the most logical option for GME to expand revenue</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

With EU exchanges disabling trading of BBBYQ those FTDs are all stuck and can&#39;t be closed out.</p>\n\n<p>What this means for us, I don&#39;t know. Does this mean they will need to buy those shares within 35 days before they show up on US exchanges, or is it done to stop the bad actors from destroying the evidence as the investigation closes around them? Or was it done by the bad guys to buy time so that they do not need to deliver those shares, since EU shareholders can&#39;t sell their shares anyway? Maybe they are hoping the shares get wiped and by then they won&#39;t need to deliver them.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, this was done on purpose. Either by bad actors or some regulators, we saw so much short action every morning for months and barcoding all afternoon. There is no way that it was normal trading that caused a 30-40% drop every day in the 2 hours before EU markets closed and then nothing for the rest of the day.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind the good guys already prepaid NASDAQ fees with their S1/S3 filing which was canceled meaning if the company emerges from ch11 it will most likely be fast tracked back onto the exchange, which would also reopen trading on the EU exchanges, and putting those FTDs back into play.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Every few weeks they have had 800m shares of calls for an entire year. Retail has no reason to buy $45 strike options while the stock is trading for pennies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As it stands:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In OTC you can no longer buy new options contracts and they can only be exercised. This means the longer we are in OTC the more of their calls expire.</p>\n\n<p>If we make it to Jan 19th 2024 on OTC, the 800m shares worth of calls they have from before expire, and they lose their hedge and locates FORCING them to close.</p>\n\n<p>THIS is why I believe we have been seeing this delay. As the clock runs down, more and more of their options have been expiring. Jan 19th 2024 is the FINAL expiration date, sealing their fate. As long as those options exist, they have set a limit to their damage and can shift the burden to whoever sold the contract. The shorts will never be on the hook for more than the strike on those contracts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Terminating Exclusivity:</strong></p>\n\n<p>So is this why all of a sudden there is this claim of fraud being filed to remove the BK plan exclusivity, which would have run until EXACTLY that week of January? Seems plausible.</p>\n\n<p>By terminating the exclusivity period, it allows others to present a plan and speed up this BK process and get BBBY shares disposed of, BEFORE those options expire.</p>\n\n<p>I have little doubt that as soon as the exclusivity period is over we will be presented with a lowball offer which they will then force through. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there is an offer for 3-4B on the table as soon as the court order is filed. Just enough to pay all the creditors and some pennies for us in return for all the old shares getting extinguished.</p>\n\n<p>Remember the Hertz BK deal? Shareholders got 3% of the new shares, or a loss of 97% of their ownership stake.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, any offer that is accepted by enough of the creditor classes does not require our consent. We are LAST in line. What do the creditors care if they are getting paid in full? Might as well take the lowball offer? If shareholders are thrown some pennies, the judge has no reason not to approve the deal either.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, all the talk about shorted bonds and is to distract from their real plan in hopes that shareholders will help shoot themselves in the dick and let them end the exclusivity.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>So while I was getting attacked in my last post, this may clarify why I believe that there is more to this docket than meets the eye. My other post would have turned into a book if I had added all of this as a side note to the main point I was making.</p>\n\n<p>There are at minimum 4 &quot;groups&quot; in this who will throw EACH OTHER under the bus if it benefits them. We know the Good Guys, Freeman and his Relatives (bondholders), The Shorts, and the Banks / Market Makers / Counterparties for the swaps.

If the good guys get their exclusivity taken away it could allow freeman&#39;s family to present an offer just slightly higher than what is currently on the table, forcing our side to spring the bear trap before it is ready, IF it is even possible at that point.</p>\n\n<p>Freemans family held basically ALL the 24 bonds and they tried to value BABY for 300m last year in hopes of snapping it up once they forced bbby into bankruptcy. RC SAVED us with the 6th street loan and now they are trying to get the exclusivity removed so they can tank the deal with a counter offer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What if:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Exclusivity is removed AND Freemans FAMILY make a credit bid for Baby for lets say $500m RIGHT NOW. This would force a bidding war between them and our team BUT also screws up the complex structure of RC/Icahn&#39;s deal.</p>\n\n<p>Any offer higher than the dream on me offer would have to be considered because it could lead to more money for CREDITORS. OUR team has a 69D chess play though as we all know and many of the traps they are using DON&#39;T WORK in a bidding war and depending on what the plan is, even a SHARE offer which forces shorts to close could not be possible.</p>\n\n<p>It would also reduce OUR cut massively because in a bidding war WE ARE PAID LAST. As you have seen so far, many debts have been reduced, which wouldn&#39;t happen if creditors know there is a big payout on the way. But they are paid first so we only get paid if there is more than enough to pay them in full.</p>\n\n<p>This outcome basically screws our share, drive up the cost for RC and the team. or even nuke the entire thing and we get nothing.</p>\n\n<p>This screwing up the exclusivity has been my big worry since the filing was mentioned during the hearing and I am actually pissed PP knew about it and kept it secret. This should have been public, so they don&#39;t get blindsided in court.</p>\n\n<p>All the docket 1728 posts it seems the bots are really pushing them, just like old time FUD pushes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Life the Plant:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Life_Relationship has built a rep in the community JUST LIKE ROACH, then in recent weeks as we have gotten more and more POSITIVE NEWS his DD has gotten more and more shillish. All under the guise of analyzing things with a realistic view of the filings. We all know this play is supposed to trap the shorts and obviously has to make things look bad. We have been given enough clues though to know things are not the way they seem. Life also posts his &quot;DD&quot; in the bbby sub where most of the OGs who could uncover his deception are banned and can&#39;t reply. I think after seeing how quickly roach was unmasked they decided to be more careful with their next plant. The reason &quot;life knows his stuff&quot; as pp said is because he is a plant, just like roach knew his stuff, but turned &quot;bearish&quot; over BS.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If I am wrong I will be the first to apologize, but just like with roach I called it as soon as he started to flip. If they manage to push this through and get the exclusivity removed it literally could be our downfall.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The only hope</strong> is that this takes off before the exclusivity is needed, as the lawyers said it was only out of abundance of caution. BUT his claims of fraud could delay things to run out the clock. In connection with the exclusivity getting removed, it would be the perfect outcome for our enemies. This is the absolute worst time to do something like this, which is why this proves it for me that Life is a plant.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PS</strong>. The Hertz restructuring plan that was accepted came from GLENN and we know that Icahn sold just days before the squeeze happened. So did Icahn step back because Glenn managed to push through the alternate restructuring plan? I still need to dig in more. I actually found the first clue with the Glenn and Hertz connection from a shill. The Hertz plan saw equity get paid but not much and if you didn&#39;t sell during the squeeze you lost out. This could be our future if the shills win.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

They need to bring back focus onto what their core business is and not venture out into buzzword crypto hype.\n\n**Movie theaters' main weakness is also their strength.** They require large real estate which is mostly empty for large periods of the day and even during main business hours.\n\nIf you have ever left the movie mid-show you will know that the hallways, and food stalls are all EMPTY. This is a major cost that is underutilized.\n\nInstead of letting this space go to waste, it could be turned into a strength by offering a movie themed entertainment experience more along the lines of a carnival. This is a low-cost opportunity to increase revenue with little up front investment and low running costs.\n\nImagine halls lined with Movie themed stalls, offering games, shopping, food and entertainment. Disney has seen huge success with their movie themed parks such as Harry Potter world and others. This could be replicated in the halls of the theater and turning the theater experience into more than just going to see a movie but an outing more like going to an amusement park. Sports stadiums have done this for a long time and rive huge sales, through restaurants etc.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nPrepaid cards simplify purchases for food, snacks and entertainment, to speed up sales and throughput. A few $100k per theater\n\nModular stalls that can quickly be re-themed for different movies, to sell movie themed, food, snacks, games, and toys. \\~$1.5m per theater\n\nAdd proper rotating theme restaurants offering movie themed meals, since many people go to eat before the movie. $2m per theater\n\nMove the ticket checks to the movie's doors, giving the public access to the gaming, food, and merchandise sales. Allowing the public to spend without watching a movie. \\~$100k for 20 movie theater\n\n**Result:**\n\nThese changes could increase the revenue per guest by several 100%. Instead of selling a movie ticket and snack for \\~$20 you can also sell the pre movie meal, a toy, and additional entertainment.\n\n*Lets assume a Star Wars movie release:*  \nMovie Ticket $15-20  \nTie Fighter Lego set $20-30  \nFlight Simulator ride $5-10  \nOuter Rim Restaurant Meal $15  \nSnacks $10\n\nPER CUSTOMER\n\nBy turning what would have been a 2 hour movie into a 3-4 hour mini themepark outing, utilizing dead space you have more than doubled your revenue. With little extra investment\n\nIn addition, it opens opportunities for marketing deals, and promotional partnerships, IE movie themed candy, Lego sets, other toys, \n\nA movie might pay to set up a game booth as marketing for their movie or video game.\n\nConsumers hate the ads at the start of a movie, but are much more receptive to ads that are disguised as entertainment.\n\nYou can offer band/play performances and special events in off seasons and increase revenue through merch sales.\n\nThis is how you could expand the offering of the movie theater into something the customer can't get at home. Offering yet another branded credit card or NFT is not going to save your movie theater chain.\n\nUntil I see AMC start making some of the right choices, you are basically hoping for someone to buy them out, or some other news to force the shorts to close. Both of these are simply looking to leave someone else holding the bag and not keeping a movie theater experience for people to enjoy years into the future, which will also cause upheaval for the movie industry, which is largely financed by the box office sales.", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

(the cash is unimportant to this, it only applies to pay off debts)</p>\n\n<p>So many shares in fact, that the shorts who are on the hook for the dividends of the shorted shares, need to go out and buy all those shares of Company A to pay out their short positions on the open market causing a second squeeze.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let&#39;s say:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Company A has 10M shares outstanding</li>\n<li>Company B has 100M shares plus 100m shorted (ie 200m total)</li>\n<li>Company A, buys company B in a share plus cash deal.</li>\n<li>Company A gives 1 share of company A for 10 shares of company B.</li>\n<li>20M shares are supposed to change hands but only 10M come from company A, the rest need to be bought by shorts on the open market to pay their obligations.</li>\n<li>Now company A has 20M shares outstanding. Where do the other 10M shares come from that the shorts need to pay out?</li>\n<li>Since there are not enough shares of company A to pay the obligations of the shorts you get a squeeze of company A in addition to the squeeze of company B, for any positions that need to be closed in order to cover the missing shares.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obviously I just picked random numbers to make the math easier to follow but depending on the situation this can have huge implications for the buying pressure of company A and your ownership % after all is said and done.</p>\n\n<p>This could be interested in a situation where the FTC wouldn&#39;t approve a direct buyout, but after the deal, your ownership has grown enough to give you a controlling stake.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The BEST PART</strong></p>\n\n<p>This would allow you to force 2 squeezes at once with little to no warning to any of the shorts involved, especially if you can hide who the buyer is, in order to reduce the time for shorts to close positions before the deal is announced.</p>\n\n<p>Where this would get really interesting is, if a bunch of highly shorted companies were all to be merged at once into some form of giant holding company, launching a whole series of squeezes at the same time and making it much harder to figure out how much risk you are exposed to as a shortseller. This could amplify a squeeze exponentially.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If for example:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Deal 1 causes Company A and B to squeeze</li>\n<li>Deal 2 causes Company C and D to squeeze</li>\n<li>Deal 3 FORCES the shorts to deliver a ton of shares for all 4 companies at a time when all their shares are highly inflated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This could be done in many variations as above or even as a chain of company A paying in shares for company B, and Company A is then bought by company C, and they are then bought by company D. </p>\n\n<p>At each level the squeeze would build as the shorts need to buy shares on the open market to pay out obligations on their loans. The starting point for each squeeze being the height of the previous squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine what would have happened if the day GME reached $400 a share the company was sold in an all share deal requiring the closing of every last short position.

A few of us have been assuming that they would pretend to get this over with quickly to keep the shorts from closing, and then move all the dates back and stretch this out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is that a good thing?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well the derivatives settlement dates coming up around those times.</p>\n\n<p>All those fancy Credit Default Swaps, Total Return Swaps, Bullet Swaps, Basket Swaps, etc., etc. end on 3, 6, 9, 12 month cycles.

Synthetic ETFs are derivatives that track the price of an underlying asset without owning that asset. This is done for tax reasons and is similar to a CFD, or contract for difference. Since these investments are not backed by any shares, it allows them to grow in size, way beyond any limits that would be imposed by shares outstanding.</p>\n\n<p>For example, If there are only 1 million shares available that is how many bets against that share can be made, while still being backed by physical shares. A synthetic ETF however can be sold an unlimited number of times, because it only depends on share price and not on the number of shares.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Anyway I am getting off topic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>These Derivative investments usually have expiration dates tied to them which just so happen to pile up around certain dates, and this is what creates our cyclic stock runs.</p>\n\n<p>The next big settlement &quot;pile up&quot; just so happens to be june-august. </p>\n\n<p>Since there is more risk for the shorts and hedge funds around those dates, it only makes sense to announce the buyout around those dates and cause the maximum flood of shorts rushing to close their positions, in order to reduce their losses as much as possible, while at the same time the flood of closures, drives the price of the stock up past uranus.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Not only is he corrected by someone who speaks Japanese and translated the email, matching to what has come from other brokers, the user also confirmed that Rakuten and Namura are not connected. Something I had already verified before.</p>\n\n<p>U-Copy claims the emails came from one of his viewers (classic blame deflection) but is adamant that his viewer is correct and list YAHOO FINANCE as his credible source to back it up. We all know yahoo finance is compromised and working for the shorts, so to use them to back up a claim, that is already being contested as false, is highly suspect.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I know people will say I am overreacting, and I would have given him the benefit of the doubt if he hadn&#39;t reacted the way that he did to being corrected.

Which leads me to believe that the list was created at least a couple of weeks later. 150+ DRS accounts don&#39;t show up overnight.</p>\n\n<p>How much later it was created is anyone&#39;s guess. Did BBBY specifically call up AST to get a new count? Or did they submit an earlier copy, like we have seen them do with some other materials. It can&#39;t be the same list that they got the April 10th count from, and it can&#39;t be the list from the &quot;date of record&quot; for the shareholder vote since that was March 27th a full 2 weeks before April 10th.</p>\n\n<p>My guess is that very few people DRSed shares after AST went down. Since the list was filed in the afternoon on the 5th it could very well be from that day, for all we know, but since all trades take 2 days to settle, it must be at least 2 days out of date.</p>\n\n<p>That means not only could that list be over 100 million shares off, when considering the trading volume for those 2 days. Who is to say that Cede and Co even submitted the ACTUAL share count.</p>\n\n<p>For all we know, Cede and Co could have taken the highest number they found on some filing and added 1/2 the reported shorts to it. Why 1/2 you ask? Because they are about 50 million over the highest number I have found, and there hasn&#39;t been any days when they could have substantially reduced the short interest.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, we are still waiting until the 9th to get the short interest for the 2 weeks of highest volume, including that 900m day. Judging by the 30% increase on the last 2 weeks, this one won&#39;t be much better. I doubt anyone closed, after we declared BK.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Well, I am rambling, so I will stop here. just wanted to put some thoughts out there about possibilities I had eliminated. I still think the actual share count is much lower than expected, and the real FLOAT is even lower.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I hope you all are ready for the CARNAGE on monday as the shorts rip each other to shreds, to close.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

You can even raise the CTB and they have 25 min to agree or return the shares. <a href=\"https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/twsHelp/usersguidebook/specializedorderentry/about_stock_borrow_loan.htm\">(According to IBKR lending guide)</a></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>The offer will be tiny because of BK</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Not true, not only are there various protections, to stop predatory companies from driving down the price, but we know the buyer is trying to get the shorts and has made a previous valuation of what the assets would be worth. It is my assessment that it would be hard for that same buyer to convince a Court that they were off by an order of magnitude with all the evidence of shorts manipulating the price.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>The price will never go higher than a few cents</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Not true. The moment there is an offer announce the price will jump TO THAT OFFER amount, Giving us a massive boost from which the price will continue to rise as the shorts, naked shorts, etc NEED TO COVER. Especially in a deal, where a single entity will own 100% of shares, they would expose themselves to a recall that would create an INFINITY pool, or negotiated settlement situation.

I believe whoever took that deal will still be profitable, taking the buyout offer. I believe this offer will be many times higher though.</p>\n\n<p>Kais mentioned a pre-inflation price of $142, which I have seen come up in my math before.  Remember the $80 options? They wouldn&#39;t have been worth exercising unless the price went over.</p>\n\n<p>What could be meant by inflation? Was it the buyout price + shorts squeezing the price upwards?

On the flip side it also lets them transfer leases more easily</p>\n\n<p>In the commercial leasing world, sometimes there are special terms that can work in your favor or against you.</p>\n\n<p>One of them can be a clause against rent increases. A mall might do this for anchor stores that they believe will bring in more customers making their other leases more valuable.</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago I had read about a lease in the Mall of America that was practically free.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure if BBBY has ANY of these types of leases but due to their size and number of locations there is a decent chance that they do.</p>\n\n<p>Lets say you have a lease with favorable terms, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Low revenue share %. (Yes, Malls will take a % of SALES many times)</li>\n<li>10-20 year lease in an area that has gone up in price with several years left on it.</li>\n<li>Open-ended lease with a set rate for the life of the contract.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Before, we have only considered the ease of transfer of a lease, as a marketable asset. The value of a lease could come from many other factors.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you signed a 20 year lease, in NY a few years ago, Your monthly rate could be several times less than what a new lease would cost you. A single lease contract could save a tenant millions over the span of several years.</p>\n\n<p>Or if you have a revenue share lease in a mall, a company selling luxury goods might save millions by taking over the favorable rate of the previous lease. Best Buy, Apple Store, Micro Center, Movie Theater might do $100k+ in sales a day. Saving just 1-2% could be worth $5-10 million in savings a year.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you just consider the rate of inflation, you would probably see substantial savings from each and every lease you can sell to another business.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Multiply this by 400+ stores, you could be looking at another doubling of our current market cap in hidden value.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Real Estate:</p>\n\n<p>BBBY has many Real Estate Subsidiaries, which leads me to believe that they do own at least 17 of their own stores and rent them back from themselves. They are not used as collateral for the loans of the company according to the Business Structure Matrix in the court filings. I don&#39;t know how that works with BBBY being 100% shareholder in each of these entities but there could be additional value there.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>We keep focusing on a Squeeze or Buyout/Merger but I think when you add it all up whoever the buyer is, is not just some White Knight, they are making out like a bandit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

That was barely 100 shares.</p>\n\n<p>If I have interpreted this deal right which I believe I have, it will be similar to the Jefferson Airplane Matrix club deal. They had 3 guys buy 75% of the club for $9k and the founder kept 25% of the shares.</p>\n\n<p>If you use $9B as the buyout price for BBBY and subtract the debt you end up with roughly the buyout price per share I have been predicting for the last few weeks.</p>\n\n<p>So let&#39;s assume someone gave BBBY $9B to pay down debt and buy up 75% of the company, leaving us owning 25%.</p>\n\n<p>That could fund quite a bit of expansion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BBBY</strong></p>\n\n<p>We have seen lots of posts about international job postings lately, which I believe point to global expansion.</p>\n\n<p>The news of this event will be a marketing campaign worth many billions, and with Apes spread all over the world, you have a customer base that you can only leverage fully if you go international.</p>\n\n<p>My guess would be to first go ecommerce only, leveraging a unified distribution network and marketplace setup to offer many brands while optimizing logistic costs.</p>\n\n<p>However in the EU there are many BBBY competitors that are doing VERY well and could find it hard to keep up with a company with as many advantages as BBBY would enter the market with.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Home Automation</strong></p>\n\n<p>As I have mentioned before, the current state of home automation is a mess of different systems that lack compatibility. </p>\n\n<p>If BBBY used its scale and market penetration to build a unified home automation system they could incentivize brads to use their system to lower costs, while using the higher adoption rates to increase sales, by automating certain task such as reordering consumables. </p>\n\n<p>Every time you use your home automation system will be a chance to make a sale.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if your fridge could tell you that the light bulb is broken and at the click of a button order a replacement. Or your water system could order replacement filters as needed. This would lock customers to BBBY and their product offerings much more than a rewards membership ever can.</p>\n\n<p>An expansion or partnership into gardening/hydroponic product should definitely be explored since consumables such as potting mixes, fertilizers, seeds and other items could bring a constant stream of revenue in addition to equipment such as lights, pumps, and more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Baby</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gone are the days of big ugly diaper bags and Baby will be the international leader for baby products. Beyond getting the customers hooked into your ecosystems early and keeping them for life, passing them from subsidiary to subsidiary as they grow older. Young parents spend lots of money on their kids and because they grow quickly, the replacement rate for clothing and other products is measured in months not years.</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention a global brand recognition and wealthier middle class in Asian countries with a huge focus on education will allow baby to bring in revenue from a wide variety of Toys and Educational products.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Teddy Publishing</strong></p>\n\n<p>Teddy Publishing would make a great name for a children&#39;s book/ebook/edutainment company that offers self-publishing for ANIMATED ebooks, normal books, and entertainment/educational products.</p>\n\n<p>CSS animation and audio web APIs have come a long way in recent years, while tablets and phones are everywhere. If you were to offer a platform similar to Flash for quickly and easily publishing animated books, audio books, magazines, etc. You could become the Steam or App store of books and edutainment products. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Educational books with built-in quizzes.</li>\n<li>Animated magazines with integrated mini games.</li>\n<li>Books that come to life.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By offering self-publishing access, you ensure a steady stream of content with big margins and low costs. This could also be offered in partnership or as it&#39;s own company for Teens, and Adults. Think along the lines of a Cookbook with animated recipes, or DIY/Home Improvement magazine with animated guides. Even &quot;How To&quot; books could benefit from animated content and if you already have the systems in place, it is a no brain path to expansion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>What I am trying to say is, BBBY and BABY could have a massive growth potential with the recapitalization and publicity the coming weeks will bring. I believe that they could be the fastest growing company over the next 10+ years.</p>\n\n<p>Most of my suggestions can be implemented with an investment measured in the $10s of millions, but what gives BBBY the big advantage is US because WE ARE THE VALUE.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I really need to stop writing these book length posts. I hope someone on the inside sees this because when I think about the deep value that BBBY and Baby has and the possibilities, with the right team and capital behind it, I get really excited for what the future holds. If this thing doesn&#39;t squeeze past at least $420.69 I am holding because I am in no rush. Those people who got richest from Microsoft are not those who sold at the IPO, but those who HODLed for the DEEP FUCKING VALUE play.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Ideally below $15. It is harder to say how much dilution has an effect on the buyout price depending on how much our buyer already owns of the diluted shares. If he owns 50% it may be worth it to pay $10B for the other 50%.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>RC valued the company a $5-30B if it managed to reach profitability. At 30B even post dilution that is $30 a share.</p>\n\n<p>It all comes down to the Revenue multiple we can achieve. $6B Revenue x6 (Like Etsy) puts us at $36B.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>THIS IS NOT OVER.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>PS. I may be wrong, BBBY seems to still control the leases on many of the stores they already closed. If this is the case, then there is tremendous value there to a potential buyer in the real estate subsidiaries. Opening a new store usually takes 18\u201324 months, of negotiations, etc. and if you can cut that time by 3-6 months x 400 by taking over the lease free and clear, someone like Wallmart, TJX or Target could be willing to throw you a couple million. We know Tritton renovated 600 stores, and depending on which stores were kept and for how long, we could be looking at several hundred million in value.</p>\n\n<p>When you are talking about parting out a company, THESE are the types of things that bring big value that is not accounted for in a balance sheet.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>None of this is financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

We will go over each technique  and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to  eventually and effectively gain a control of a &#39;uncontrolled forum.&#39;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technique #1 - &#39;FORUM SLIDING&#39;</strong></p>\n\n<p>If  a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a  forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by &#39;forum sliding.&#39;  In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned  on the forum and allowed to &#39;age.&#39; Each of these misdirectional forum  postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a &#39;forum slide.&#39; The  second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be  called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public.  To trigger a &#39;forum slide&#39; and &#39;flush&#39; the critical post out of public  view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and  fake and then &#39;replying&#39; to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2  line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum  list, and the critical posting &#39;slides&#39; down the front page, and  quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to  censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful  postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the  forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technique #2 - &#39;CONSENSUS CRACKING&#39;</strong></p>\n\n<p>A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at <a href=\"http://www.abovetopsecret.com/\">www.abovetopsecret.com</a>)  is &#39;consensus cracking.&#39; To develop a consensus crack, the following  technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made  which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the  critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive  proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake  accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced  over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are  initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which  side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger  &#39;evidence&#39; or disinformation in your favour is slowly &#39;seeded in.&#39; Thus  the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you,  and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting  will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum  members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with  real facts and linked postings, you can then &#39;abort&#39; the consensus  cracking by initiating a &#39;forum slide.&#39;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technique #3 - &#39;TOPIC DILUTION&#39;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Topic  dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful  in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues.  This is a critical and useful technique to cause a &#39;RESOURCE BURN.&#39; By  implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and  disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped  from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual  dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop  researching and simply slip into a &#39;gossip mode.&#39; In this state they can  be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed  conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective  and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that  you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper  assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is  first determined of the group to determine at what level to &#39;drive in  the wedge.&#39; By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger  censorship by a forum moderator.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technique #4 - &#39;INFORMATION COLLECTION&#39;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Information  collection is also a very effective method to determine the  psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence  that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive  environment a &#39;show you mine so me yours&#39; posting is initiated. From  the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical  information can be gathered. An example is to post your &#39;favourite  weapon&#39; and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what  they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what  percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal  weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form  members and posting your favourite &#39;technique of operation.&#39; From the  replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and  effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technique #5 - &#39;ANGER TROLLING&#39;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Statistically,  there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined  to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a  requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a  strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group  can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly  local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a  link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his  power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million  or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught  abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used  for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to &#39;stage&#39;  a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so  the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful  to &#39;lead&#39; the forum by replying to your own posting with your own  statement of violent intent, and that you &#39;do not care what the  authorities think!!&#39; inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it  may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined  violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real  intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technique #6 - &#39;GAINING FULL CONTROL&#39;</strong></p>\n\n<p>It  is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a  forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can  then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable  postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure  and lack of interest by the general public. This is the &#39;ultimate  victory&#39; as the forum is no longer participated with by the general  public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on  the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum  into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and  or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can  be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a  forum as it can be converted into a &#39;honey pot&#39; gathering center to  collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used  for your control for your agenda purposes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM.</strong>  Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely  fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues  must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to  simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable  as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the  percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for  control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and  developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of  infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ.</p>\n\n<p>____________________</p>\n\n<p>Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation</p>\n\n<p><em>Note:  The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules are  generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo  artist to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those  at the leadership, key players, or planning level of the criminal  conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. <strong>Regardless of what you know, don&#39;t discuss it</strong>  -- especially if you are a public figure, news anchor, etc. If it&#39;s not  reported, it didn&#39;t happen, and you never have to deal with the issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Become incredulous and indignant.</strong>  Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can  be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct  group or theme. This is also known as the &#39;How dare you!&#39; gambit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Create rumor mongers. <strong>Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations.</strong>  Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well.  This method which works especially well with a silent press, because the  only way the public can learn of the facts are through such &#39;arguable  rumors&#39;. If you can associate the material with the Internet, use this  fact to certify it a &#39;wild rumor&#39; from a &#39;bunch of kids on the Internet&#39;  which can have no basis in fact.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Use a straw man.</strong>  Find or create a seeming element of your opponent&#39;s argument which you  can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to  look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on  your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or  select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their  significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the  charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion  of the real issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule.</strong>  This is also known as the primary &#39;attack the messenger&#39; ploy, though  other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents  with unpopular titles such as &#39;kooks&#39;, &#39;right-wing&#39;, &#39;liberal&#39;,  &#39;left-wing&#39;, &#39;terrorists&#39;, &#39;conspiracy buffs&#39;, &#39;radicals&#39;, &#39;militia&#39;,  &#39;racists&#39;, &#39;religious fanatics&#39;, &#39;sexual deviates&#39;, and so forth. This  makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label,  and you avoid dealing with issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Hit and Run. In any public forum, <strong>make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded</strong>,  or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and  letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new  identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism,  reasoning -- simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing  issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would  dignify the opponent&#39;s viewpoint.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7.</strong> Question motives. <strong>Twist  or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent  operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias.</strong> This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8.</strong> Invoke authority. <strong>Claim  for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your  argument with enough &#39;jargon&#39; and &#39;minutia&#39; to illustrate you are &#39;one  who knows&#39;</strong>, and simply say it isn&#39;t so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.</strong> Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, <strong>avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility</strong>, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. Associate opponent charges with old news.</strong>  A derivative of the straw man -- usually, in any large-scale matter of  high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were  already easily dealt with - a kind of investment for the future should  the matter not be so easily contained.) Where it can be foreseen, have  your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as  part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless  of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be associated with  the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need  to address current issues -- so much the better where the opponent is  or was involved with the original source.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11.</strong> Establish and rely upon fall-back positions. <strong>Using  a minor matter or element of the facts, take the &#39;high road&#39; and  &#39;confess&#39; with candor that some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made</strong>  -- but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out  of proportion and imply greater criminalities which, &#39;just isn&#39;t so.&#39;  Others can reinforce this on your behalf, later, and even publicly &#39;call  for an end to the nonsense&#39; because you have already &#39;done the right  thing.&#39; Done properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for &#39;coming  clean&#39; and &#39;owning up&#39; to your mistakes without addressing more serious  issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>12.</strong>  Enigmas have no solution. Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events  surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events, <strong>paint the entire affair as too complex to solve</strong>.  This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to lose  interest more quickly without having to address the actual issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>13.</strong> Alice in Wonderland Logic. <strong>Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic</strong> which forbears any actual material fact.</p>\n\n<p><strong>14.</strong> Demand complete solutions. <strong>Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely</strong>, a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for rule 10.</p>\n\n<p><strong>15. Fit the facts to alternate conclusions.</strong> This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>16. Vanish evidence and witnesses.</strong> If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you won&#39;t have to address the issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>17. Change the subject.</strong>  Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a  way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments  in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This  works especially well with companions who can &#39;argue&#39; with you over the  new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing  more key issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents.</strong>  If you can&#39;t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw  them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish  and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less  coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first  instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you  can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how &#39;sensitive they are  to criticism.&#39;</p>\n\n<p><strong>19. Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs.</strong>  This is perhaps a variant of the &#39;play dumb&#39; rule. Regardless of what  material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the  material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent  to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be  something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a  murder weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may  be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or  books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny  that statements made by government or other authorities have any  meaning or relevance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>20.</strong> False evidence. <strong>Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations</strong>  -- as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution.  This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the  purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>21.</strong> Call a Grand Jury, Special Prosecutor, or other empowered investigative body. <strong>Subvert the (process) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion.</strong>  Once convened, the evidence and testimony are required to be secret  when properly handled. For instance, if you own the prosecuting  attorney, it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that  the evidence is sealed and unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once  a favorable verdict is achieved, the matter can be considered  officially closed. Usually, this technique is applied to find the guilty  innocent, but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to  frame a victim.</p>\n\n<p><strong>22. Manufacture a new truth.</strong>  Create your own expert(s), group(s), author(s), leader(s) or influence  existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative,  or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In this way,  if you must actually address issues, you can do so authoritatively.</p>\n\n<p><strong>23. Create bigger distractions.</strong>  If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive  issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such  as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them as such) to  distract the multitudes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>24. Silence critics.</strong>  If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from  circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address  issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and  detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of  blackmail information, or merely by destroying them financially,  emotionally, or severely damaging their health.</p>\n\n<p><strong>25. Vanish.</strong>  If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and  you think the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the  kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>_________________________</p>\n\n<p>Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) Avoidance.</strong>  They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive  input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather,  they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about  their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the  matter without any further justification for credibility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2) Selectivity.</strong>  They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either applying the  hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents,  or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly  address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any  success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3) Coincidental.</strong>  They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new  controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in  general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They  likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern.  They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and  vanish with the reason.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4) Teamwork.</strong>  They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or  teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but  there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this  sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will  infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other  tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5) Anti-conspiratorial.</strong>  They almost always have disdain for &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; and,  usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask  yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do  they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on  conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools  of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such  disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior  motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6) Artificial Emotions.</strong>  An odd kind of &#39;artificial&#39; emotionalism and an unusually thick skin --  an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming  criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence  community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny  everything, and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net  result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial.</p>\n\n<p>Most  people, if responding in anger, for instance, will express their  animosity throughout their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have  trouble maintaining the &#39;image&#39; and are hot and cold with respect to  pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional  communications style. It&#39;s just a job, and they often seem unable to  &#39;act their role in character&#39; as well in a communications medium as they  might be able in a real face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You  might have outright rage and indignation one moment, ho-hum the next,  and more anger later -- an emotional yo-yo.</p>\n\n<p>With  respect to being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them  from doing their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo  patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is  that they play that game -- where a more rational individual who truly  cares what others think might seek to improve their communications  style, substance, and so forth, or simply give up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7) Inconsistent.</strong>  There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true  self/motives. This may stem from not really knowing their topic, or it  may be somewhat &#39;freudian&#39;, so to speak, in that perhaps they really  root for the side of truth deep within.</p>\n\n<p>I  have noted that often, they will simply cite contradictory information  which neutralizes itself and the author. For instance, one such player  claimed to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills  (spelling, grammar, incoherent style) on having only a grade-school  education. I&#39;m not aware of too many Navy pilots who don&#39;t have a  college degree. Another claimed no knowledge of a particular  topic/situation but later claimed first-hand knowledge of it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8) Time Constant.</strong>  Recently discovered, with respect to News Groups, is the response time  factor. There are three ways this can be seen to work, especially when  the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up  operation:</p>\n\n<p>a) ANY NG posting by a  targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response. The  government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit  there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO IN A  NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT - FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR, or  the visitor may be swayed towards truth.</p>\n\n<p>b)  When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as  email, DELAY IS CALLED FOR - there will usually be a minimum of a 48-72  hour delay. This allows a sit-down team discussion on response strategy  for best effect, and even enough time to &#39;get permission&#39; or instruction  from a formal chain of command.</p>\n\n<p>c)  In the NG example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns  are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay - the team  approach in play. This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker  or their comments are considered more important with respect to  potential to reveal truth. Thus, a serious truth sayer will be attacked  twice for the same sin.</p>\n\n<p>______________________</p>\n\n<p>How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent)</p>\n\n<p>One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group that does all the wrong things. Why?</p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> The message doesn&#39;t get out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> A lot of time is wasted</p>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> The activist is frustrated and discouraged</p>\n\n<p><strong>4)</strong> Nothing good is accomplished.</p>\n\n<p>FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they have phoney activist organizations established.</p>\n\n<p>Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from developing in this country.</p>\n\n<p>Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female.</p>\n\n<p>The  actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant.  It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on  the spies and saboteurs.</p>\n\n<p>This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists.</p>\n\n<p>It is the agent&#39;s job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus keeping him/her under control.</p>\n\n<p>In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re dividing the movement.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>[Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works to control people]</p>\n\n<p>This  invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The  agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask  of &quot;dedication to the cause.&quot; Because of their often declared  dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize  the activist, he or she - being truly dedicated to the movement -  becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is  because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a  conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that &quot;on  purpose.&quot; It&#39;s amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist  because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who  regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do,  occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own  eyes by rationalizing: &quot;they did that unconsciously... they didn&#39;t  really mean it... I can help them by being forgiving and accepting &quot; and  so on and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>The agent will tell the activist:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re a leader!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This  is designed to enhance the activist&#39;s self-esteem. His or her  narcissistic admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions  increase as he or she identifies with and consciously admires the  altruistic declarations of the agent which are deliberately set up to  mirror those of the activist.</p>\n\n<p>This  is &quot;malignant pseudoidentification.&quot; It is the process by which the  agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the  activist&#39;s identification with him/her, thus increasing the activist&#39;s  vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle  self-concepts of the activist.</p>\n\n<p>Activists  and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable to  malignant pseudoidentification especially during work with the agent  when the interaction includes matter relating to their competency,  autonomy, or knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The goal  of the agent is to increase the activist&#39;s general empathy for the agent  through pseudo-identification with the activist&#39;s self-concepts.</p>\n\n<p>The  most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the  activist for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a  more subtle level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the  activist which promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of  &quot;twinship&quot;. It is not unheard of for activists, enamored by the  perceived helpfulness and competence of a good agent, to find themselves  considering ethical violations and perhaps, even illegal behavior, in  the service of their agent/handler.</p>\n\n<p>The  activist&#39;s &quot;felt quality of perfection&quot; [self-concept] is enhanced, and  a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her  imitation and simulation of the victim&#39;s own narcissistic investments.  [self-concepts] That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own  dedication to the cause, they will project that onto the agent who is  &quot;mirroring&quot; them.</p>\n\n<p>The activist  will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling of  identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the  adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the  establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic  splitting so that &quot;twinship alliances&quot; between activist and agent may  render whole sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist.  They literally &quot;lose touch with reality.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Activists  who deny their own narcissistic investments [do not have a good idea of  their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts] and consciously  perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be &quot;helpers&quot; endowed  with a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the  affective (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent.</p>\n\n<p>Empathy  is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible  affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear,  remorse, and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong  sense of compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activist&#39;s  narcissistic investment in self as the embodiment of goodness.</p>\n\n<p>The  agent&#39;s expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling  to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion.</p>\n\n<p>It can usually be identified by two events, however:</p>\n\n<p>First,  the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is  aware of his/her own potential for being &quot;emotionally hooked,&quot; will be  able to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the  agent.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of this  unaffected, cool, attitude, the Second event will occur: The agent will  recompensate much too quickly following such an affective expression  leaving the activist with the impression that &quot;the play has ended, the  curtain has fallen,&quot; and the imposture, for the moment, has finished.  The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim.</p>\n\n<p>The fact is, the movement doesn&#39;t need leaders, it needs MOVERS. &quot;Follow the leader&quot; is a waste of time.</p>\n\n<p>A  good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a  lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved  discussions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner: (-&gt;</strong> <a href=\"/u/moonshot_69\">u/moonshot_69</a><strong>)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> To disrupt the agenda</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> To side-track the discussion</p>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> To interrupt repeatedly</p>\n\n<p><strong>4)</strong> To feign ignorance</p>\n\n<p><strong>5)</strong> To make an unfounded accusation against a person.</p>\n\n<p>Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of all other group members.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Saboteurs</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will ....</p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Write encyclopedic flyers (in the present day, websites)</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> Print flyers in English only.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> Have demonstrations in places where no one cares.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4)</strong> Solicit funding from rich people instead of grass roots support</p>\n\n<p><strong>5)</strong> Display banners with too many words that are confusing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6)</strong> Confuse issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7)</strong> Make the wrong demands.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8)</strong> Compromise the goal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9)</strong>  Have endless discussions that waste everyone&#39;s time. The agent may  accompany the endless discussions with drinking, pot smoking or other  amusement to slow down the activist&#39;s work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provocateurs</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Want to establish &quot;leaders&quot; to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> Suggest doing foolish, illegal things to get the activists in trouble.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> Encourage militancy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4)</strong> Want to taunt the authorities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5)</strong> Attempt to make the activist compromise their values.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6)</strong> Attempt to instigate violence. Activisim ought to always be non-violent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7)</strong> Attempt to provoke revolt among people who are ill-prepared to deal with the reaction of the authorities to such violence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Informants</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> Ask a lot of questions (gathering data).</p>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4)</strong> Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or her beliefs, goals, and level of committment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recruiting</strong></p>\n\n<p>Legitimate  activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialog. Their  actions, beliefs, and goals speak for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Groups that DO recruit are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Surveillance</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>ALWAYS</strong> assume that you are under surveillance.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, if you are NOT under surveillance, you are not a very good activist!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scare Tactics</strong></p>\n\n<p>They use them.</p>\n\n<p>Such  tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to  disaffected or minimally committed fellow activists to persuade them  (via psychological tactics described above) to turn against the movement  and give false testimony against their former compatriots. They will  plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest; they will  plant false information and set up &quot;exposure,&quot; they will send  incriminating letters [emails] in the name of the activist; and more;  they will do whatever society will allow.</p>\n\n<p>This booklet in no way covers all the ways agents use to sabotage the lives of sincere an dedicated activists.</p>\n\n<p>If an agent is &quot;exposed,&quot; he or she will be transferred or replaced.</p>\n\n<p>COINTELPRO  is still in operation today under a different code name. It is no  longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the freedom of  information act.</p>\n\n<p>The FBI counterintelligence program&#39;s stated purpose: <em>To  expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize  individuals who the FBI categorize as opposed to the National Interests</em>.  &quot;National Security&quot; means the FBI&#39;s security from the people ever  finding out the vicious things it does in violation of people&#39;s civil  liberties.</p>\n\n<p>___________________________</p>\n\n<p>Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression</p>\n\n<p><em>Strong,  credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down a  government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense,  other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques  depends heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token  opposition party.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Dummy up.</strong> If it&#39;s not reported, if it&#39;s not news, it didn&#39;t happen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Wax indignant.</strong> This is also known as the &quot;How dare you?&quot; gambit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Characterize the charges as &quot;rumors&quot; or, better yet, &quot;wild rumors.&quot;</strong>  If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn  about the suspicious facts, it can only be through &quot;rumors.&quot; (If they  tend to believe the &quot;rumors&quot; it must be because they are simply  &quot;paranoid&quot; or &quot;hysterical.&quot;)</p>\n\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Knock down straw men. <strong>Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest charges.</strong>  Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or plant  false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the  charges, real and fanciful alike.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Call the skeptics names like &quot;conspiracy theorist,&quot; &quot;nutcase,&quot; &quot;ranter,&quot; &quot;kook,&quot; &quot;crackpot,&quot; and, of course, &quot;rumor monger.&quot;</strong>  Be sure, too, to use heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when  characterizing their charges and defending the &quot;more reasonable&quot;  government and its defenders. You must then carefully avoid fair and  open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned. For  insurance, set up your own &quot;skeptics&quot; to shoot down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Impugn motives. <strong>Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth</strong>  but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make  money (compared to over-compensated adherents to the government line  who, presumably, are not).</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Invoke authority.</strong> Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. Dismiss the charges as &quot;old news.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>9. Come half-clean.</strong>  This is also known as &quot;confession and avoidance&quot; or &quot;taking the limited  hangout route.&quot; This way, you create the impression of candor and  honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal  &quot;mistakes.&quot; This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back  position quite different from the one originally taken. With effective  damage control, the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge  skeptics to carefully limited markets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex</strong> and the truth as ultimately unknowable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11. Reason backward</strong>,  using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous  deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely  free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster &quot;suicide&quot; note was  forged, they would have reported it. They haven&#39;t reported it so there  is no such evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the  likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press who would report the leak.</p>\n\n<p><strong>12. Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely.</strong> E.g. If Foster was murdered, who did it and why?</p>\n\n<p><strong>13. Change the subject.</strong> This technique includes creating and/or publicizing distractions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>14. Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them.</strong> This is sometimes referred to as &quot;bump and run&quot; reporting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>15. Baldly and brazenly lie.</strong> A favorite way of doing this is to attribute the &quot;facts&quot; furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous, source.</p>\n\n<p><strong>16.</strong> Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, <strong>have your own stooges &quot;expose&quot; scandals and champion popular causes.</strong>  Their job is to pre-empt real opponents and to play 99-yard football. A  variation is to pay rich people for the job who will pretend to spend  their own money.</p>\n\n<p><strong>17. Flood the Internet with agents.</strong>  This is the answer to the question, &quot;What could possibly motivate a  person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news groups defending the  government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics?&quot; Don t the  authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines,  radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical  letters and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio  talk shows would be control enough, but, obviously, it is not.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

They ALL depend on the RETAIL INVESTOR though, for them to make their payday.</p>\n\n<p>WE ARE THE VALUE</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s assume for a minute that the powers at the top screwed retail with the buy button removal to save their own asses and that they did the same with BBBY.</p>\n\n<p>How do you help those who have a $29 Cost basis? You push the price down to nothing so that they can average down for 1/100th of their original buy in. That would get you a lot of credibility and CONFIDENCE with retail that you won&#39;t leave them hanging.</p>\n\n<p>How do you make sure that the squeeze is big enough for everyone to profit? You keep setting trap after trap, after trap, making it look like absolute incompetence to the point even the hardcore believers start to doubt you.</p>\n\n<p>WE ARE THE VALUE</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Elon Musk paid $40 Billion for Twitter without ever making a profit. EToro isn&#39;t just a shit broker, they are a CRYPTO broker, and much regulation doesn&#39;t apply to them. How much is the NYSE or NASDAQ worth? NOTHING if nobody uses them.</p>\n\n<p>How much is an Amazon competitor worth is nobody uses it? NOTHING.</p>\n\n<p>WE ARE THE VALUE.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Someone converted BBBY warrants at $6.15 even though the stock price was way below that.</p>\n\n<p>Sue filed the Interview with the SEC because that makes it official info and she can&#39;t get sued for her Rumor comment like RC did for his tweets.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I believe there are multiple reasons for the Proxy Co switch. The least likely being that they wanted to avoid liability or didn&#39;t feel comfortable. One it bought them time between the date of record and the vote. During that time they could convert warrants and all kinds of things without having to announce or file them or the cash they raised through those conversions.</p>\n\n<p>They actually didn&#39;t create more shares in order to dilute, they simply moved shares around. Those shares existed in Nov, and Jan, They were put into reserve for those warrants and BBBY bought back pref warrants for a lump sum payment of 10mil shares + 5 mil shares post split (if it happens). That means BBBY OWNS 100 mil shares worth of warrants. </p>\n\n<p>We didn&#39;t see the influx of trading and shorting until after the march reporting period was over. March 30th, T+2 for settlement allowed them to start early. They sold 300Mil shares short in 5 Days. With 80mil shorts already on the SI.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s keep in mind this deal was made so confusing that even the shills said they had never seen such a deal before. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I believe we will get the first sign TOMORROW. </p>\n\n<p>The 25th we will see new SI numbers and I believe around then we will also get our Q4 Financials.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the financials will be much better than expected.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$1.2B in Rev with 1/2 the stores</li>\n<li>20m Rewards Members &lt; -- WE ARE THE VALUE</li>\n<li>Modest cash usages.</li>\n<li>Many ONE TIME store closing costs to absorb.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Anyone claiming the board hasn&#39;t done shit, should be viewed with suspicion. January we saw they were moving in the right direction, it is less than 2 WEEKS BEFORE Q4 data comes out. Triton took 3 years to sink this ship and they havn&#39;t even had 3 full QUARTERS yet.</p>\n\n<p>All I know is that Retail investors being on your side and believing in YOU is worth more than 5 BBBYs and Babys. We spent BILLIONS on shares and moved markets. </p>\n\n<p>Elon saw the power of Retail when building Tesla (which was also short attacked), and RC saw the value of Retail Investors with GME/BBBY.</p>\n\n<p>I think that no matter what the play is, <strong>WE ARE THE VALUE</strong>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

They brought in a top notch team and everything we have seen would require utmost incompetence if it wasn&#39;t planned or malicious. I think they were giving us a chance to get our numbers up, to MAXIMIZE Value for the shareholders. If you invest $10k into AMD and it runs few $ you make a couple hundred. If you buy $10k worth of BBBY, and it runs a few $ you are buying a house. My only regret is buying in too early.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/RCioR0flCgStqHd6IThD7RqNfU0PgKNbzVkVuQH6P8U.jpg\"/></div>"},

This companies stock is worth almost it&#39;s ENTIRE market cap in yearly CTB fees. March has been a month with substantially lower CTB and even if we are not getting rich somebody is. Just think of all those months with 100% CTB and a price of $6-12 per share. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This also leads me to believe there has been lots of naked shorts. IE. brokers lending more shares than they own or lending synthetic shares. At $40-80m Market cap you wouldn&#39;t reach $8 mil a month with over 200% CTB and 100% utilization. We never went over 127% of float shorted and that was pre dilution. Since end of Feb there supposedly were many more shares and much lower fees. Either the short term borrowing is really bringing in the money or we are at least 2x more shorted.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Source:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/mi/research-analysis/securities-finance-march-snapshot-2023.html\">https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/mi/research-analysis/securities-finance-march-snapshot-2023.html</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
