Keep using logic. Get your price targets established, build spreadsheets, run scenarios, see how much you will have in equity at certain prices. </p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t sell because it\u2019s more money than you\u2019ve ever had before. Don\u2019t let the large price scare you. The isn\u2019t just a short squeeze. This stock is prepared to soar from now to the end of days. You may never be able to acquire this stock again for the same price as you sell. </p>\n\n<p>Also we are so close to February and I know many of us jumped in late January. Holding through the squeeze until the 12 month holding anniversary will increase your profit as you won\u2019t be paying as high a tax penalty and will be considered a long term holder. </p>\n\n<p>Bonus thought: Not having access to AST to sell our DRS\u2019d shares will have a positive effect on the price. Since retail owns so much, the 24-48 hours it takes regards to access their shares once the new stock appears is a good thing. </p>\n\n<p>Also: Any Bobby sailors here?</p>\n\n<p>TDLR: be logical. Make a plan. Don\u2019t get caught with your emotions. Think about those times you wanted to text a girl and then did and regretted it because it made you look needy.
