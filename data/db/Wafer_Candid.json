You know what I don't like to hear dsily? We being abused by HF's and tiranic governmets!! That's the real pain we are up against. Listening to someone struggle to convey his ideas because English is not his main language, and still is trying to defend my interests? I could have that all day for the rest of my life!! \n\nThis is a person with a courage most of us don't have, even when clearly English is not his mother language. Still he moved and acted!! \n\nIf this tells anything is that most people in this community are not only retarded but also disgusting stupid bullies. I would love to see any of you doing even 10% Life Relationship is doing, considering you have perfect English. Not even with that huge advantage you would be half the man he is!! \n\nAnd it doesn't matter if you agree with him or not!! It is his liberty to pursue what he believes is right!!\n\nSo shame on you Life bullies!!! You disgust me and make me feel ashamed!!!\n\nCongratulations Life Relationship, keep up with that knowledge and strength you have!! We all should follow your example!!", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
