I have read the DD, spent my own time verifying the information and I am convinced of this play. I understand life must be pretty miserable for you to consider a career shilling on the internet. Maybe you think you are not doing any harm to anyone, maybe you think you have no option but to do this, to wake up everyday, go online and spread negativity. But you need to understand that, you are doing something incredibly vile. You help destroy instead of creating. To help someone to spread misinformation, to help someone who wouldn&#39;t give a rats ass about you to save themselves through you. </p>\n\n<p>Remember, whoever is paying you to spread this information is betting on most of us on this sub failing. Us failing means, they are not getting margin called, it means they don&#39;t have to live on ramen, it means they have enough money to pay you to continue to do your job. Just ask yourself, what happens when they don&#39;t have any money to pay you? What happens when we are right? Just ask yourself what happens to you when your salary is due next month? You are not going to get paid, you will be tossed away like yesterday&#39;s trash and you will not have any way to get your money. You can&#39;t go to the cops, you can&#39;t go to courts, what are you gonna tell? Are you gonna admit to the cops that you are a online troll and didn&#39;t get paid? There&#39;s some hope for you though, yes you missed this play but, if you figurer what else they are asking you to go spread rumors around, and you bet against it you might also make it. You should know, the fact they are using you to spread something means they are scared, worried and want us to do what you are being told to tell us.</p>\n\n<p>The fact of the matter is, no amount of what you say is going to convince me otherwise. I am a crazy person. I am convinced this is going to happen. I am convinced I have already won and that its just a matter of time before we hear of our win publicly. The only person, the only only person who can tell me otherwise right now is, Ryan Cohen himself, no one else, no amount of shills bots or even the good lord himself can convince me otherwise. Yes, like I said I am crazy! And here&#39;s the most amazing part, I believe most people on this sub are also a bunch of crazy dildo worshiping degens, and we all have unwavering conviction this is the play and its going to work. </p>\n\n<p>So, save yourself my friend, start preparing your resume and look for a better line of work. Be a builder instead of a destroyer, be a positive person instead of someone who manipulates and lies. Maybe then, your life will improve and you will start being happier.</p>\n\n<p>As for the shills doing this for free, believe it or not, I actually like you for you too are a crazy person like me, we just happen to disagree on a topic. Hope you have a great day, all the best! </p>\n\n<p>one last thing, here&#39;s a two hour video on what&#39;s happened so far, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dZqpSGA2Hc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dZqpSGA2Hc</a></p>\n\n<p>tldr; update your resume.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83d\udca9  Shit Post \ud83d\udca9 Likely to be deleted \ud83d\udca9 ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#dadada"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

From the so called &quot;meme&quot; stock basket, I have held ONLY GME up until now, but after yesterday&#39;s shit show I decided I HAVE to buy BBBYQ. If I am wrong, and lose everything, meh, big whoop. It&#39;s my money, I spend it on what I want. No one has to lose sleep over it lol.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to BBBYQ truth is, I hadn&#39;t spent enough time reading up on the dd or followed by on things too much. I don&#39;t usually invest in something if I don&#39;t understand what the hell I am investing in. But at this time, I am invested in this mainly based on the amount of hate you bbbyq folk are getting. Holy shit its unreal.</p>\n\n<p>At yesterdays show, what <a href=\"/u/RealPulte\">/u/RealPulte</a> mentioned at 2:50:00 made me look at him in a completely different way, I think I need to apologize to <a href=\"/u/RealPulte\">/u/RealPulte</a> . I thought you are trying to get attention to yourself by attaching yourself in this movement. But after I heard that bit I have nothing but respect for you for saying that. Love definitely is the ONLY way we can make a better world.</p>\n\n<p>As for the donation thing, come the fuck on people, if someone thinks its worth donating $500 to meet and hangout with Pulte why the hell is anyone getting angry over that, plus the donation goes to helping the team that&#39;s created this I think its really sweet to see.</p>\n\n<p>Anywhoos, just wanted to tell everyone here not everyone thinks this community is crazy. Okay, okay, you are all one step away from wearing tinfoil hats, but I would rather be part of a bunch of crazies that believe in doing the right thing and letting everyone have their voices heard, over people who think they are somehow better than everyone so they gotta protect others with hate and force.</p>\n\n<p>All the best everyone.
