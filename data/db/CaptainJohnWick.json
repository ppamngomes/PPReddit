Technically maybe - with the current plan. But as we have known since the plan was submitted - amendments are expected to be filed either tonight or by Monday open. </p>\n\n<p>So for those unsure what\u2019s happening - NO shares will not magically disappear Monday morning. Notice must be received from my broker with adequate time to action \u2014 I spoke with my broker (CIBC) as I bought another 5k shares and she confirmed they have not received any additional information regarding bbbyq. </p>\n\n<p>Salvatore has mentioned - for shorts to be force to close, a new CUSIP # and name change must take place. This gets extremely technical as the going concern must be preserved at the same time for the NOL\u2019s to be reserved for future use (this should be 2+ billion at this point). </p>\n\n<p>Now I want to ask all of you \u2014 in what world does anyone become a CEO of a company and receive no compensation? Doesn\u2019t happen without a specific reason. </p>\n\n<p>Now if RC was receiving compensation for being GM CEO - then there would be the issue of conflict of interest\u2026 but as you are aware he is not an openly stated that he is involved with other business activities. </p>\n\n<p>To finish off this post - I want all of us to think for a moment, when we went up 89% on Wednesday - why didn\u2019t any news outlets mention a word about BBBYQ? If this was truly expected to go to 0 - we should\u2019ve seen multiple articles saying bbbyq is saved/squeezing\u2026 instead they post when we have a -4% day, with something along the lines - shares will be extinguished Friday. </p>\n\n<p>If I have learned anything from Mr.Buffett the news will never tell you to invest when there is opportunity- they will ensure the public sees the  said company (bbbyq) in a negative manner to minimize/mitigate risk. </p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: this is not financial advice. Also thank you to the legends that have continuously researched and shared their findings. This is the collective approach needed to end the shorts. </p>\n\n<p>Best,</p>\n\n<p>A</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"nsfw\"/></div>"},

The price dropped under .19 multiple times but the order did not fill. What is important about this is the a week prior I was able to fill orders up to 5k in shares instantly, and typically under the market price. This is a massive step, as fake/ghost/synthetic shares are not moving. In a stock where people (us regards) are holding/been holding, technically the fills should\u2019ve been like this since the move to otc, but this wasn\u2019t the case until yesterday. Today (Friday) I have seen several test orders ( low share amount, price: .01/.02 higher) not fill..</p>\n\n<p>This is the first sign of a squeeze. Shares are not being traded instantly. We now await the court/bidding to lay out the shareholders plan within this restructure. </p>\n\n<p>Shorts and everyone involved is utterly ducked. </p>\n\n<p>Be patient and know our time is almost here. It has been an honour my fellow regards.</p>\n\n<p>Love to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts on this!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
