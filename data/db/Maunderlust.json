That seemed rather silly, and just a little suspect. So, the contrarian in me is posting it here for even more visibility. I hope it&#39;s insightful, or useful, or just amusing. I don&#39;t think it breaks any sub rules but I&#39;ll take it down if so. Maybe I&#39;m being paranoid but I think the main takeaway is that there may be something suspect going on with the mods over there.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The original post in its entirety:</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Someone on the original post commented there\u2019s a special something on part 2 at 5\u2019 10\u201d (\u201cFull speed ahead Mr. Cohen!\u201d)</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s some light-hearted tinfoil for you all as we navigate this process.

This seems like a pretty fair interpretation. But as my mind was wandering this morning I suddenly remembered this two-part <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=monty+python+corporate+raiders\">Monty Python sketch</a> which, in retrospect, seems to thrust (so to speak) to the heart of the current matter at hand- Squashing the shorts via mergers and acquisitions.
