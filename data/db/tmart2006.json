I will provide links for everything that I&#39;ve found and would love some help from my fellow apes to dive deeper. I would ultimately love to find out who is behind these lawsuits because I have a strong suspicion it&#39;s all been coordinated by those with short positions.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong> - The law firms representing the Movants and Plaintiff in Ryan Cohen pump and dump lawsuit are the same law firms that represent the plaintiff&#39;s in the lawsuits against IEP(Icahn) and the lawsuit against former CEO of overstock Patrick Byrne.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m pulling all the initial information from the RC lawsuit itself.

Plaintiff in RC lawsuit.   <strong>PENGCHENG SI</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Represented by <em>Cohen Milstein Sellers and Toll Pllc</em><a href=\"https://www.cohenmilstein.com\">https://www.cohenmilstein.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Jan Messerschmidt<a href=\"https://www.cohenmilstein.com/professional/jan-e-messerschmidt\">https://www.cohenmilstein.com/professional/jan-e-messerschmidt</a></p>\n\n<p>Steven J. Toll<a href=\"https://www.cohenmilstein.com/professional/steven-j-toll\">https://www.cohenmilstein.com/professional/steven-j-toll</a></p>\n\n<p>It also looks as though Pengcheng Si represented themselves in the beginning. Here is the website to what i assume is his(?) law firm? It all seems very shady</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dwslawgroup.com/home/\">https://dwslawgroup.com/home/</a></p>\n\n<p>The Cohen Milstein group is also representing a fraud case against Overstock and their former and current executives, as laid out here on the website of Cohen Milstein</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cohenmilstein.com/case-study/re-overstock-securities-litigation\">https://www.cohenmilstein.com/case-study/re-overstock-securities-litigation</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Next up is the Movant in RC Lawsuit. <strong>BRATYA SPRL</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By far, the award for most representation, goes to this individual. So I&#39;m sorry if I don&#39;t name every single lawyer, the list is in the first link provided.</p>\n\n<p>Also, this is where things get interesting between this lawsuit and the one against Icahn. It seems as though all the firms representing the Movants are a part of the lawsuit against IEP(Icahn).</p>\n\n<p><em>Pomerantz LLP</em><a href=\"https://pomlaw.com\">https://pomlaw.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Attorneys</p>\n\n<p>Christopher TourekGenc ArifiJeremy A.
