But I can assure you: there's not long to go before we get a major update on this play. Here's why...", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>No blue boxes today, because this is a very simple post!</p>\n\n<p>Exactly three weeks ago, I made a post about the registration filing by 20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc. with the State of New York Department of Corporations:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/s/L6SRpBEG89\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/s/L6SRpBEG89</a></p>\n\n<p>The crux of that DD is that this company is required, under New York state law, to update certain information about their company registration every two years:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dos.ny.gov/biennial-statements-business-corporations-and-limited-liability-companies\">https://dos.ny.gov/biennial-statements-business-corporations-and-limited-liability-companies</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Domestic and foreign business corporations are required by Section 408 of the Business Corporation Law to file a Biennial Statement every two years with the New York Department of State. The Biennial Statement must set forth: *</em>(i) the name and business address of its chief executive officer*<em>, (ii) the street address of its principal executive office (iii) the address to which the New York Secretary of State shall forward copies of process accepted on behalf of the corporation and (iv) the number of directors constituting the board and how many directors of such board are women.</em></p>\n\n<p>The currently registered information is that the CEO is Mark Tritton, because that is what was stated in the last <strong>required</strong> Biennial Statement filed in October 2021. However, the registration page makes what is next <strong>required</strong> VERY clear:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.dos.ny.gov/publicInquiry/EntityDisplay\">https://apps.dos.ny.gov/publicInquiry/EntityDisplay</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>NEXT STATEMENT DUE DATE:10/31/2023</strong></p>\n\n<p>So I believe we are basically <em>guaranteed</em> to have one of the following three outcomes by next Tuesday:</p>\n\n<p><strong>(1) Mind Blower:</strong> They make the filing, it states who 20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.&#39;s CEO is. Either who that person is, or what their background is, tells us a lot about the direction of travel we are heading towards from now. It also, most likely, tells us the final effecting of whatever is happening in the background...is close.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(2) Time Buyer:</strong> They make the filing, and it states the CEO is the Plan Administrator for the ongoing Chapter 11 proceedings, Michael I. Goldberg. This might seem like a &quot;nothing burger&quot;, but at least it does indicate that - most likely - whatever play is happening, it is just going to take more time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(3) Cock Teaser:</strong> They don&#39;t make the filing, presumably taking the $50 fine for not doing so by the deadline. This might seem like an even bigger &quot;nothing burger&quot;, but I think this would be really quite telling. Essentially, it means they are prepared to ignore or even break state law, in order to preserve the secrecy of whatever they are doing behind closed doors. So in many ways, this non-action is also pretty exciting in itself!</p>\n\n<p>So I am hitting the F5 &#39;refresh&#39; button on that New York State registration page every day now. Because whichever of the three scenarios above happens between now and month end...it is going to be an intriguing data point for us to digest. Not long to go!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
