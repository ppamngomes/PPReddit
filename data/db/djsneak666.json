They are usually executed via the <a href=\"https://www.ig.com/uk/glossary-trading-terms/otc-definition\">over-the-counter (OTC)</a> market. Off-book transactions are made directly between two parties, outside or \u2018off\u2019 of the order books.</p>\n\n<p>Once a price has been agreed between the two parties, it is typical for one of the participants to report the trade and its parameters to the exchange \u2013 and wider market \u2013 in order to bring the execution <a href=\"https://www.ig.com/uk/glossary-trading-terms/on-exchange-definition\">&#39;on exchange&#39;</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When you trade on exchange, the trade takes place directly onto the order book and is seen as increasing visibility for wider market participants.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>BBBYQ FTD&#39;s were pretty wild right before the next ones failed to be published:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c0p594j3oh0c1.png?width=1590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ab311d3b18100baa469cfe80bbacc7a6de1f4eb\">https://preview.redd.it/c0p594j3oh0c1.png?width=1590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ab311d3b18100baa469cfe80bbacc7a6de1f4eb</a></p>\n\n<p>I am not drawing any conclusions at this point in time but lets put the points together in a TLDRS: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>FTD&#39;s on BBBYQ getting wild</li>\n<li>LSE goes down on 19th</li>\n<li>GME begins trading off-book</li>\n<li>New BBBYQ ticker appears on LSE around the same time</li>\n<li>SEC fails to publish FTD&#39;s as expected at start november</li>\n<li>middle of November FTD&#39;s still not published</li>\n<li>Market pumps and GME starts a wild cyclical run with the rest of the basket</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>seems sus to me. I am not knowledgeable enough to work out what the London connection is but tinfoil theories are welcome. Are they using the LSE to manipulate the FTD&#39;s somehow? is that how GME has relatively low FTD&#39;s when we know they are likely much higher? and why did a BBBYQ ticker pop up on there when all this was going on?</p>\n\n<p>Anyways thought this was worth posting as seen all these things being discussed separately but no one tying them together. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/V1Okdz0YbtXGlI9s2wDPj9CjACn63c2hd0p8KEqEZe0.jpg\"/></div>"},
