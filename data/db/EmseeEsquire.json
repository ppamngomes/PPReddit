The support team will do everything they can to avoid forwarding your message, but if you insist (threaten a report to FINRA if they don&#39;t comply), they will eventually acquiesce. </p>\n\n<p>If enough of us file a complaint, maybe they&#39;ll take us seriously.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
