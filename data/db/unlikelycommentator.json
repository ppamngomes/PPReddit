Anyone have an opposing view and thought on latest developments and vote?</p>\n\n<p>Would be great if badger or someone else from there could join tonight as well.</p>\n\n<p>2.\nAssuming a \u201cwar\u201d in management, any thoughts on how the split may be? Board vs C-suite level of directors?\nSome of the moves like hiring M&amp;A experienced staff seems strange if the board is not onboard with an acquisition.</p>\n\n<p>3.\nThoughts on the broker non-votes and abstains being counted as Against-votes on split?</p>\n\n<p>4.\nIt was recently discussed that someone converted 90m Common Stock Warrants to stock for $6.15 each, but I think we primarily focused on the fact that someone would pay that.\nAny thoughts on what that capital injection does for the company?</p>\n\n<p>5.\nThe company put in filings that they expect BK around 26th if no split. Is that off the tabel? Any signs in filings of a change in that?</p>\n\n<p>6.\nGiven the state of NYs more strict anti takeover laws, could the RS vote be just for show, giving credibility to the board claiming a takeover really is hostile, becausr they attempted a poison pill with dilution?</p>\n\n<p>\u2014-</p>\n\n<p>In general it would be great to hear everyone\u2019s opinion on these things to get an idea of how prevailing these sentiments are.</p>\n\n<p>I think that\u2019s it from me, but please feel free to add more in comments, or answer my questions there \ud83d\ude42</p>\n\n<p>Looking forward to a spicy show tonight!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nGiving up on fixing formatting with item 1\u2026</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nThe tweet from Roach:\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/halroach13/status/1647620621096943619\">https://twitter.com/halroach13/status/1647620621096943619</a></p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Added question 6.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "", "text_color": "", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
