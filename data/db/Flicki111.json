The problem is ( I think) that a lot of shitposts, shillposts and memes (dont get me wrong, I enjoy memes myself) are watering down the precious DD and are distracting from the actual relevant posts.   \nI would love to start an app, where retail investors can have a voice and provide their opinions in an environment which is especially made for that, writing DD.   \nBy giving a voice I honestly mean positives as well as negatives but being transparent if a post is bullish or bearish. People should be able to comment and down or upvote. You should also be able to discuss multiple stock tickers. I think it would be nice to have the opportunity to provide \u201eCounter-DD\u201c to oppose certain posts of other users and to \u201edebunk\u201c them. It would be nice to have a \u201eshill counter\u201c and \u201ehype counter\u201c to measure if a ticker is overhyped or suppressed (by counting up and down votes and compare it to up and downvotes of counter DD, for example).   \nIn addition to that it could help to get peoples DD on top results of search engines and get people\u2018s mind away from think \u201ethese are just some guys on reddit\u201c.   \nSo what do you guys think of that idea? Maybe it is just stupid but I think this is the only way I could possibly contribute to the movement.   \nMaybe some of you with similar skills want to help out?   \nLet me know in the comments.   \nAlso: Shorts have not closed.
