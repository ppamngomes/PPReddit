Cause that is a big fee to pay.\nIf so then can one try to count the amount if the % of tax from these type of transactions are known?

What would shorts buy?\n(Yes I get the \u201csell 1 share for gazillion\u201d argument but lets be real).</p>\n\n<p>Could PP take up this subject during the show and hypothetically explain how this would play out?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks guys.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

You might ask.\nWell its a loyal army of rather wealthy investors who trust their activist investor.</p>\n\n<p>Think of it as a school of fish (the retail investor) following one big fish. What it does, the school does after it.</p>\n\n<p>You want to take over a company but the board will take steps from stopping you from owning the majority of voting power? Well now you an army of individual investors who can buy up shares and together have a majority in voting power and will follow what the Leader says.\nAn example - lets say you have 10 000 investors who have 500 k each (post moass) to spare. Thats 5 billion. Not bad right?</p>\n\n<p>I think that is a goal for an activist investor worth fighting for. Especially if that army has also gained a few years worth of experience in the stock market.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
