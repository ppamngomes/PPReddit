It has happened enough times to catch my attention even though I have been brushing it off. In 2005, i had a major life event occur surrounding one particular number that I kept seeing everywhere and it was a warning. I also saw these numbers before I saw today that Ryan Cohen is on the list of interested buyers and honestly, I didn&#39;t believe that he was interested or in the play anymore, but I never stopped seeing that 741...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff4500"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
