[Photo 1]</p>\n\n<p>In a brief search for posts mentioning Gibbons P.C., I found a couple of interesting things.</p>\n\n<p>Gibbons P.C. is mentioned in Docket 1333: Application for Retention of Professional Gibbons P.C. as Special Counsel on Behalf of Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. [Photo 2]</p>\n\n<p>In this docket, we see that Ryan Cohen is listed as an interested party. [Photo 3]</p>\n\n<p>In this same docket, Gibbons P.C. explicitly states they were brought on to resolve concerns specifically with respect to Net Operating Loses (\u201cNOLs\u201d). In a previous post by Life Relationship, they speculated on the involvement of Icahn regarding BBBYQ bonds based on Icahn\u2019s connection with the banks listed under interested parties. [Photo 4]</p>\n\n<p>The question is why was this docket withheld? Is there revealing information pertaining to RC, Icahn, or NOL preservation? \ud83e\udd14</p>\n\n<p>To play devils advocate, the fees requested are much smaller compared to the other applicants. This may very well be a nothing burger. \ud83c\udf54</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/rN-EH4olE0-kPAK7dZcOa1CXWKeYrHIZCN_CnuykTFs.jpg\"/></div>"}]
