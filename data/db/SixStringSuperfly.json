My research into Sears Canada has run parallel with my research into Sears Holdings with Shagspeare/SearsForever. </p>\n\n<p>Sears will never die!  \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\uddf0 \u267e</p>\n\n<p>Sears Canada was spun-off from Sears Holdings a few years ago to become a separate company, with Sears Holdings keeping around 10% of Sears Canada.  (Sears Holdings also spun-off Lands&#39; End and Seritage Growth Properties.)</p>\n\n<p>Sears Canada went through Canadian bankruptcy (CCAA) and still exists as a bare-bones company with a handful of assets.  Sears Canada still has two offices in Toronto (82 Peter Street and an office in the Eaton Centre mall), Sears Floor Covering Centres, and a handful of subsidiaries under the name Initium.</p>\n\n<p>Initium was a project started before bankruptcy to turnaround the company and explore some new business ideas.  One idea was a discount store, similar to Marshalls or TJmaxx, called The Cut.  The subsidiary also still exists, but I&#39;m not aware of any current operations or storefronts.</p>\n\n<p>While Sears Canada went through CCAA, most of its retail footprint was taken over by Nordstrom and... Buy Buy Baby.</p>\n\n<p>Canadians seem to have a fondness for Sears Canada.  Sears Canada also owns the Eaton&#39;s brand, a former Canadian retailer with some very cool history.  Lady Eaton was a classy lady.  She opened The Carlu event venue, aka &quot;Eaton&#39;s Seventh Floor&quot; in Toronto and Eaton&#39; Ninth Floor in Montreal,  which is due to reopen in 2024!  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cultmtl.com/2023/03/the-eaton-centre-ninth-floor-restaurant-in-montreal-will-reopen-show-venue-included/\">https://cultmtl.com/2023/03/the-eaton-centre-ninth-floor-restaurant-in-montreal-will-reopen-show-venue-included/</a></p>\n\n<p>Sears Canada also seems to have a presence on TikTok, where they beef with Wal-Mart, talk of their &quot;Flop Era&quot;, and hint at a partnership with Zellars (another Canadian brand making a comeback).<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@sears_canada\">https://www.tiktok.com/@sears_canada</a></p>\n\n<p>Yes, Sears Canada has been cellar boxed.  I purchased shares at .0065/share.  SRSCQ still has short interest and continues to have random ass trades at random intervals.  Two shares were traded for .33/share a few days ago.  108 shares were traded at 1.99 yesterday, and so far, it looks like one share has traded today at 1.99.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, not a very organized post, but I thought I&#39;d drop some knowledge/tin foil.   Sears is quite the rabbit hole, and nothing makes sense. Happy to discuss further in the comments.  </p>\n\n<p>Also, beware the Sears shills.  They are out there for sure.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
