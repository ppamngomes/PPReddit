To sum up a possible way to approach it from your responses:\n- Open up account with a US broker and enable pink sheet trading (this could take a few days)\n- Check the market for news in the meanwhile, they might re-open the trade of BBY under another ticker on the German market\n- If there is no outlook for a German broker that will continue trading BBY or BBBYQ, then a depottransfer of BBY is the way to go\n- After the depot transfer BBY needs to be converted to BBBYQ (at 5$ cost per batch) this requires &quot;pink sheet&quot; trading</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
