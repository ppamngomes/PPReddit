But someone who is putting a crap ton of money into BBBYQ either A) is not rationale or B) has the money to risk. Either choice negates them from being a man of the people that they are championing themselves as. I totally understand your hatred for the inequity of the capitalist system and that you want to stick it to Wall Street/hedgies. But your anger turned hope is misguided and misdirected towards people that are masquerading as working class heroes. PP, AJ, OkBets etc are not your friends. Their complete lack of risk aversion/lack of empathy for what their audience will possibly lose is sociopathic behavior. This message isn\u2019t for people betting 100,00+ on this. It\u2019s for those of you betting $500 of your $1000 savings. The people that are going to be skipping rent or bills because some sociopaths with too much money think this is fun to do in their free time. This will probably get deleted quickly or dismissed outright but please if this can just reach one person, get out now. I\u2019m sure them telling you that seeing the wonders of the deep is tempting but you don\u2019t have to stay on a sinking ship to view them.", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
