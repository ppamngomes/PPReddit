One overly lengthy post strongly hinted that some equity interests would maybe (?) be transferred into a new vehicle with an All-Star team of directors and other assets from the prior company:</p>\n\n<p>The full post (which at print time has 36.5k views on X, plus an incalculable number from reposts) concludes, \u201cBuckle up my Unwavering Butterflies, it\u2019s ice cream time.\u201d Pathos abounds.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s wearisome for a few reasons. The most important one is that, like most conspiracy theories, it\u2019s a wild overextrapolation from a small truth. The author capitalises on one fact: there will be some value preserved in the restructuring of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</p>\n\n<p>But none of that value will be going to the retail investors who own its shares. It says so in the SEC filing! With our emphasis:</p>\n\n<p>Cautionary Note to Holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the Confirmed Plan becoming effective, all of the Company\u2019s equity interests, consisting of outstanding shares of common stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company and related rights to receive or purchase shares of common stock, were cancelled on the Effective Date without consideration and have no value.</p>\n\n<p>No shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be reserved for future issuance in respect of claims and interests filed and allowed under the Confirmed Plan or pursuant to the exercise of any rights, options or other obligations of the Company to issue its common stock and/or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.</p>\n\n<p>The Company intends to file a Form 15 with the SEC deregistering the Company\u2019s common stock pursuant to Rule 12g-4(a)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d). Upon filing the Form 15, the Company intends to immediately cease filing any further periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn\u2019t get much clearer than \u201cno value\u201d and \u201cwithout consideration\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>There is value somewhere in the company, of course. Shareholders should not be the least bit \u201coptimistic\u201d about this value, however, because the restructuring plan has explicitly zeroed them out.</p>\n\n<p>Promise, there\u2019s no secret plan to help out the Little Guy: just look at the version of the restructuring plan that the bankruptcy court confirmed last month, and went into effect on Sept. 29:</p>\n\n<p>That Class 9 section above refers to you, Reddit degens. It brings us no pleasure to report this, but you\u2019ll get nothing.</p>\n\n<p>In a turn of events that was only slightly less run-of-the-mill, shareholders didn\u2019t vote on the restructuring plan. They also weren\u2019t needed; the restructuring plan says they were \u201cdeemed to reject\u201d the plan, because again: They get nothing.</p>\n\n<p>This is all the result of foundational stuff. The following won\u2019t be news to our regular readers, whose time may be better spent trying to puzzle out the fulcrum security for Hawaiian Electric Industries \u2014 good luck! And also feel free to email me to talk your book, thanks! \u2014 but in case this post makes its way into the <a href=\"/r/WallStreetBets\">r/WallStreetBets</a> universe, we figured we might as well take a stab at explaining basic corporate capital structure.</p>\n\n<p>Debt \u2014 bank financing, secured loans, bonds, et cetera \u2014 include explicit promises to repay lenders. Equities do not. And in bankruptcy, there are usually a whole lot of claims/ownership interests and not a whole lot of cash or assets to compensate them, so choices have to be made about who gets paid in full and who doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s an order to whose claims get met first, though with plenty of negotiating and gamesmanship within and between the groups. One rule of thumb is that creditors come before equity holders. (Please do read Sujeet\u2019s book about distressed investing! It\u2019s very good!)</p>\n\n<p>And really, it\u2019s that way by design. Equity gets the returns and price appreciation if a company does great, and face the greatest risk if it fails.</p>\n\n<p>For Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, the lawyers, executives, lenders and bondholders will all get paid, at least in part.</p>\n\n<p>Some of them will be offered equity in the new company instead of cash. But normal shareholders will not. By the time the corporate-value waterfall gets down to them, there\u2019s nothing left.</p>\n\n<p>There isn\u2019t a secret endgame to help the Apes; they are the game. And it has become far too easy for vague expressions of \u201csolidarity\u201d from a Pied Piper activist investor to convince normal people to shove good cash after bad, and ride a stock all the way to zero.</p>\n\n<p>Further reading:\n\u2014 PFOF and its discontents</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/optimizely/MAR090/key_icon.svg\"/></div>"},

I am detailing a small amount of information from those two new entities.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>I have been asked to make this its OWN post and include a pre-requisite to reading THIS further:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/15h21y1/have_we_seen_that_yet/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/15h21y1/have_we_seen_that_yet/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The value of this post is yet to be determined as much more data is required to weigh this specific information accordingly for any responsible evaluation. Determining who is behind these registrations, and the intentions of those registrations are not yet available. I am making NO assertation of whom could be involved, and I am curious to how and when these details will be revealed to us, the public.</p>\n\n<p>To begin, what is a Registered Agent/RA?\u00a0According to a quick interwebs, via Google:</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;A registered agent is an individual or a company that will be the LLC&#39;s or corporation&#39;s official point of contact in the state to receive service of process, other legal documents, and official communications from the state, and forward these documents and communications to the LLC or corporation for which it is acting as a Registered Agent.&quot; -</em> Specifically, from the Wolters Kluwer webpage describing a RA.</p>\n\n<p>WHY would a Registered Agent be needed?</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot; A registered agent</em> <strong><em>receives service of process and other legal documents for the entity</em></strong>*. &quot;- (cited from WIki as notated above) *</p>\n\n<p>As a small business owner, a Registered Agent/RA is a business-to-business service that provides my businesses with a legal &quot;receiver&quot; for all legal compliance paperwork. I am registered as a business in another state, thus I must have a &quot;REGISTERED AGENT&quot; in the state my business, is filed in, for &quot;Official&quot; purposes (Taxation, Legal, and Regulatory Compliance, mostly).</p>\n\n<p>This way, I cannot claim in court, if ever taken, that I &quot;did not get served any notice because I live and work in another state then where my business is registered&quot; because, I could doge a process server at my home, office, etc., or I could claim to my insurers that I never received my policy renewal notice, or there are MUTLIPLE retail locations for this entity of mine and ONE must be the &quot;Official&quot; location to receive all LEGAL paperwork etc.</p>\n\n<p>A business to be legal for operating in a state other than where is physically headquartered must have a legal Registered Agent/RA, who is basically there to receive all Legal, Federal, State and County compliance paperwork. PLEASE- This non italicized portion is my OWN definition, and it is not perfect, nor does it account for all the reasons RAs are utilized yet it MAY explain why it is being seen. BOTH these businesses above, are being registered in DELAWARE (this state is known for the positive corporate Tax and privacy standings) yet they may be operating in multiple additional states if they are indeed related to multiple locations in various states as a retail entity.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>The TWO companies in this &#39;Tin Foil&quot; have registered as business with legal, verifiable Registered agents are:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1-BuyBuyBaby GLOBAL</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2-BuyBuyBaby INC</strong></p>\n\n<p>First Up, we have...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>BUYBUYBABY</strong> <strong><em>GLOBAL</em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>a) <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/15h21y1/have_we_seen_that_yet/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/15h21y1/have_we_seen_that_yet/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>\n\n<p>b)\u00a0 THIS BBBG, has the Registered Agent of Corporate\u00a0Creations Network/CCN.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SOURCE- IMAGE OF REGISTERED AGENT, see above LINK;</strong>  <em>&quot;have we seen that yet</em>&quot; <strong>thread, here in THIS SUB</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>B1</strong>) <strong>CCN, the Registered Agent, is a COMPUTERSHARE company.</strong>\u00a0 They were acquired\u00a0by Computershare\u00a0in 2020 for 142.9M.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SOURCE</strong> for acquisition: Crunchbase</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/computershare-acquires-corporate-creations--163cb774\">www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/computershare-acquires-corporate-creations--163cb774</a></p>\n\n<p>...         ...         ...         ...         ...         ...</p>\n\n<p><strong>2 BUYBUYBABY</strong> <strong><em>INC</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A) Here is the image I have saved.

Since filing for Chapter 11, the company has been going through its assets sales process, which involves significant risks.</p>\n\n<p>The largest buyer to date for BBBYQ\u2019s assets has been Overstock (OSTK) - Get Free Report, which has acquired some of the home goods retailer\u2019s key intellectual property.</p>\n\n<p>No sales have thus been made, however, for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#39;s physical stores, including store leases, inventory, warehousing, and logistics infrastructure. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond\u2019s buy buy Baby chain \u2013 considered by some investors to be the company\u2019s crown jewel \u2013 as well as its Harmon banners have also been heretofore excluded from any transactions but are now awaiting bidders.</p>\n\n<p>Debtor-in-possession (DIP) lender Sixth Street Speciality Lending expressed interest in conducting a credit bid on some of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#39;s assets during a recent, mid-June court hearing. As of January of this year, Bed Bath owed $550 million under its asset-backed loan with JP Morgan and $375 million to lender Sixth Street.</p>\n\n<p>During the Chapter 11 process, a secured creditor is allowed to use outstanding debt they are owed as a form of payment to acquire a bankrupt company&#39;s assets. This creates an alternative to using cash in the bidding process, though it is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court.</p>\n\n<p>The potential downside with this scenario is that, if Sixth Street makes a credit bid it may discourage competition from cash bidders. This, in turn, could result in an overall lower bid price.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if the credit bid is accepted, the outstanding debt owed to that creditor is effectively reduced by the bid amount. This can alleviate some of the financial burdens on the bankrupt company, especially if outstanding debt is a significant portion of the company\u2019s liabilities.</p>\n\n<p>So far, a recent filing shows the bankrupt company&#39;s total debts have slimmed to $1.7 billion from $1.9 billion. This $200 million liability drop helped drive up BBBYQ\u2019s share price by 70% over just a few days.</p>\n\n<p>Borrowing Fees At All-Time Highs\nThose wishing to short Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares - investors who are betting the company is not worth its current $203.55 million market cap and/or that its restructuring plan will collapse - are now paying through the nose to borrow shares. Borrow fees are sitting at a whopping 100% annualized.</p>\n\n<p>Driven by supply and demand, borrowing fees vary according to the availability of shares on loan and the number of short sellers interested in betting against a stock. As the chart below shows, since mid-June, the availability of BBBYQ shares has become quite scarce, resulting in borrowing fees peaking at almost 130% recently.</p>\n\n<p>5AA0BD6B-5633-406E-84EA-19B454BB89A5\nStocksera</p>\n\n<p>While they do imply a generally bearish sentiment, high borrow fees can also increase a stock\u2019s chance of being squeezed.</p>\n\n<p>And Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#39;s stock is no stranger to short squeezes.
