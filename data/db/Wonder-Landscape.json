If anyone thinks differently, great - let's hear different opinions!\n\nA stock can be delisted from the Over-The-Counter markets. This generally occurs when a company does not meet the financial or filing requirements set by the OTC Markets Group. For example, a company may be delisted from the OTC markets if it fails to submit required periodic financial reports.\n\nIn the context of bbbyq going through bankruptcy and likely incoming liquidation, once all assets have been sold off and the company effectively ceases to exist, the stock will likely be removed from the OTC market. This would render the shares essentially worthless, as there would be no public marketplace to buy or sell them.\n\nIn rare cases, a company might successfully restructure and emerge from bankruptcy as a viable entity, which may allow for continued trading of its stock. However, in many instances, the company is liquidated, the stock is delisted, and the shares become worthless.\n\nThis isn't financial advice, it's logical deduction.

Since August 2022, every time we've seen a run, we've very quickly came crashing back down with some awful news. This isnt, I don't believe, a coincidence, I think the market makers know what's coming and when. They profit on the way up, then profit on the way down.\n\nAnyways, for once, I'm hoping this time will be different. If we do get good news we moon. Bad news, ready yourself for another death spiral. Potentially the last.\n\nLet the gambling begin, folks!", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
