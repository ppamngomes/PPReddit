I think I touched a nerve.)</p>\n\n<p>If FINRA is deliberately commenting fraud to protect their own short position in BBBY, then this is a direct conflict in interest and directly affects BBBY.</p>\n\n<p>The reason that regulatory bodies are not generally allowed to participate in the activities that they regulate is specifically to prevent these sorts of conflicts of interest. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: FINRA has access to what in any other organization would be considered massive amounts of insider information. It also has a massive conflict of interest in the form of a <strong>1.6 Billion dollar investment portfolio</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>The portfolio of the Self Regulatory Agency is largely unknown and is largely (if not completely) unmonitored by any other regulatory agency(s).</p>\n\n<p>Their actions seem to be very much as if they were desperate to save some shorties ass. <strong>Was it their own ass?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I would be really, really curious to know <strong>how much of that portfolio is short?</strong> And if they do have short positions, are their short positions in BBBY the reason that they continue to otherwise mess around with the stock.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to massive conflicts of interest and minimal supervision from the SEC, FINERA does not appear to be directly accountable to Congress, rather than direct accountability FINRA instead invests a lot of money in lobbying. In 2012, it spent $960,000 as it pushed for legislation that would allow it to expand its regulatory reach to include RIAs, who are now primarily regulated by the SEC.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FINERA should have no ability to halt any stocks or securities while it is invested in the very markets it purports to regulate.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/media/46396/download\">https://www.mercatus.org/media/46396/download</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201dLACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201dBy law, the SEC is in charge of Finra and has the power to approve or reject any rules Finra wants to adopt.

It doesn\u2019t say what the purpose of the portfolio is, it is unclear how it can even have a portfolio, and there are no specifics as to what the portfolio is benchmarked to other than a reference to a custom benchmark. The origin goes back to 2004, and it came out of the blocks trying to emulate the college endowments, which back then were revered. As a side note, the tide may have gone out some for quite a few of the endowments, but there is still plenty to learn about asset allocation from them.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201dAs the story goes, the FINRA portfolio decided to significantly reduce its equity exposure in, um\u2026.2009. The article provides no details on how much equity exposure it had back then, but the portfolio underperformed a 50/50 in 2008, or how much it has now, but there is a quote from a spokeswoman about targeting a \u201cmuch more conservative approach than a 50/50 benchmark.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p>The rolls and activities of our regulatory agencies needs to be seriously examined and heavily re-evaluated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
