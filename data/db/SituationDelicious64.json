I\u2019ve done computershare and I\u2019m familiar with their process. But what about AST. Do I have to set up an account before I DRS or is an account automatically created for me? Also if it\u2019s automatically created how to I get to my account for the first time? Also from fidelity what\u2019s the normal time between DRS and share arriving home to AST? Any other useful information would be much appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
