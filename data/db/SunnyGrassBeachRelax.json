I&#39;m now very zen as the explanation aligns incredibly well with our current situation. Here&#39;s a copy and paste of what I found.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Explanation of a butterfly transaction</strong></p>\n\n<p>A &quot;butterfly transaction&quot; or &quot;butterfly distribution&quot; is a specific type of corporate restructuring (like in the events of the BBBYQ).</p>\n\n<p>These transactions are commonly employed to efficiently separate or distribute particular assets or business segments within a corporate group e.g. like a dividend of the parent corporation I remember seeing the word distribution pop up in a lot of recent dockets in the past couple weeks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here&#39;s a breakdown of how a typical butterfly transaction unfolds:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A corporation, often termed the &quot;parent corporation,&quot; possesses two or more business divisions or assets it wishes to disentangle or allocate to its shareholders.</p></li>\n<li><p>Instead of selling these divisions or assets to external parties, the parent corporation establishes one or more new subsidiary corporations, often called <strong>&quot;butterfly corporations&quot;</strong>. </p></li>\n<li><p>The parent corporation then transfers the specific divisions or assets it intends to separate to these newly formed butterfly corporations.</p></li>\n<li><p>The parent corporation will distribute shares of the butterfly corporations to its shareholders in exchange for their shares in the parent corporation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The primary tax advantage of a butterfly transaction lies in its potential for structuring in a tax-deferred manner or achieving favourable tax treatment for both shareholders and the corporation. Furthermore, if a company emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy has significant Net Operating Losses (NOLs), a butterfly transaction can be a valuable strategy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Not an ecommerce company, but a BANK, which owns Teddy Publishing. My theory is owning BBBYQ will give you shares of teddy publishing and also a tiny portion of Teddy Holdings LLC (the parent bank company) and maybe a small cash offering per share (especially if it&#39;s like the HTZZ offering).</p>\n\n<p>When MOASS occurs, the share prices will skyrocket to let&#39;s say $10k+ a share (sorry for price anchoring). </p>\n\n<p>SHF&#39;s will get liquidated to close, which includes every long position on their books (think of stocks that boomers hold).</p>\n\n<p>Who&#39;s going to <strong>buys all the stocks</strong> for pennies on the dollar? <strong>TEDDY</strong>:  <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmxUI6kakAAs0M-?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmxUI6kakAAs0M-?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900</a></p>\n\n<p>It won&#39;t be going to an ecommerce company, but the parent <strong>BANK</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>We won&#39;t need to sell shares in a panic short squeeze because TEDDY will have massive tangible value and hold a valid high share price. Which will create a beautiful vicious cycle of contributing to the higher share price, forcing further SHF liquidiations, of which TEDDY LLC (the bank) will buy all the stocks (for cheap).</p>\n\n<p>If this new platform is based around the whole EQ/AST blockchain accuisition this will be huge, because it will mean Teddy isn&#39;t just a shell.</p>\n\n<p>Tiny Proof of Teddy llc was incorporated as a bank (found on another post, but you probably already know this): <a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2pxxjk0du61a1.jpg?width=720&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bacb123bc0e10e4dec1f92b7af90964f3353f15\">https://preview.redd.it/2pxxjk0du61a1.jpg?width=720&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bacb123bc0e10e4dec1f92b7af90964f3353f15</a></p>\n\n<p>In my opinion If you want Teddy shares, which will be highly valuable (opinion), the only way will be to DRS prior due to all the synthetics.</p>\n\n<p>If you only want quick cash then yes brokerage is fine but this also comes with the con of brokerage fuckery.</p>\n\n<p>NFA just having a crazy epiphany.
