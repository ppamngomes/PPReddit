Musk</em> <em>closed</em> <em>his acquisition of Twitter, now known as X, in October in a deal worth roughly $44 billion.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cMusk\u2019s ongoing refusal to comply with the SEC\u2019s administrative subpoena is hindering and delaying the SEC staff\u2019s investigation to determine whether violations of the federal securities laws have occurred,\u201d the attorneys wrote. \u201cAccordingly, the SEC now asks the Court to compel Musk to appear for investigative testimony.\u201d</em>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tizczx4in6tb1.png?width=2908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6a6eb74e4225cec9857f60af428c395d5b4bcdc\">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/05/sec-sues-to-force-musk-to-testify-in-twitter-probe.html</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/r30pIintAQPv2IraRZshgr5WtDouUz2iW_68k1rqDO8.jpg\"/></div>"},
