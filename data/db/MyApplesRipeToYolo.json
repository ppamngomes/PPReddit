Not a whole lot and don&#39;t have any solid plan mapped out because who knows what happens with this play, but &quot;when&quot; this bitch moons and depending how much, I&#39;d be interested in investing some of the tendies into some business ventures. I&#39;ve got a few ideas kicking around and some hires I think would fit the mold perfect. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, thought I would just toss this out here because I feel like in a few weeks this sub is going to be blown up with posts of all kinds of things and it would get lost in the madness... Anyone out here thinking about investing in some business ventures? Maybe we should exchange info and see what the future holds. I&#39;m Canadian, so likely keep it Canadian so don&#39;t have to deal with cross border bs with taxation and reporting. Although, there was a couple of US companies that ship to Canada that I was thinking maybe could squeeze a type of franchise type deal for Canadian sales... so maybe not just  Canadian.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#94e044"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
