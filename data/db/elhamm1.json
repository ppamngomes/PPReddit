You try to sleep thinking why&#39;s?? You Are ME !!\nSensing the disappointment you&#39;re grappling with, someone who wholeheartedly believed in fair markets and honest play. It&#39;s disheartening to witness the actions of those who&#39;ve turned this belief upside down through deceit and trickery. You placed your trust in a system, only to be let down by individuals employing dishonest tactics and shenanigans. Your ideals were trampled upon, and it&#39;s a bitter pill to swallow. Remember, your commitment to fairness and decency remains a testament to your integrity. Despite the deceit, your belief in a just world shines through. Hold on to that belief and keep fighting for what&#39;s right\u2014your perseverance will be the beacon of hope for genuine change. \ud83c\udf1f\nCheers to all of you.. those who believe we won and those who believe we were let down..
