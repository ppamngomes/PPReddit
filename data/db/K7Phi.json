Is it possible the nearly 11B claim is instrumental to this? </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve also heard the idea that bonds may just be reinstated into the emerging company. That would mean the approx 1B in bond debt can just be carried on and paid out over time, making bondholders whole, and again allowing the opportunity to keep shareholders intact.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/hqAF8O-ztws_781sX35-Pywr0wkGJf5kYBx1nAaC8ms.jpg\"/></div>"},

The only fee statement for July that is currently out is docket 2034 for Kroll, and this has been already discussed some what I believe.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s get to the interesting stuff. First, Sixth Street.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Image 1, June 16 - Teleconference with D. Hillman regarding credit bid.</p>\n\n<p>Remember David Hillman is the slick talking bad ass lawyer from Proskauer, representing Sixth Street/DIP lenders.</p></li>\n<li><p>Image 2, June 27 - Draft and revise issues list re Sixth Street&#39;s purchase agreement. (Credit to user PaddlingUpShitCreek for highlighting this in their post yesterday which got me curious about looking further. Again the tagging thing here, sorry)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>By now most are familiar with the qualified bidder criteria. We&#39;ll, guess what, submitting a purchase agreement was part of that criteria (See docket 92, page 20 of 120, section IV, d. &#39;Same or better terms, Bid documents). </p>\n\n<p>The fact that Sixth Street had a purchase agreement seems to imply they did in fact submit a bid in June. Ultimately, right now we have no idea if that was or wasn&#39;t the case, or what happened to the bid if it was submitted, but it&#39;s certainly interesting to me.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the pictures are just some other billed services that I also found interesting.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Image 3, June 2 - Call with potential financing party. Note this was after DIP financing was already established.</p></li>\n<li><p>Image 4, June 14 - Correspond re transferring employee records.</p></li>\n<li><p>Image 5, June 25 - Review and revise employee leasing agreement.</p></li>\n<li><p>Image 6, June 28 - Review equity transactions for executives.</p></li>\n<li><p>Image 7, June 29 - Review SEC filings re stock issued.

Multiple.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It&#39;s difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from the services from images 3-8 as their only a brief snapshot into what has actually happened, and the counter party to each service is not known. It is though some interesting insight into the types of discussions that have been held behind closed doors.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WiS0_jfwlEEaaRU_TwKDY5rqiPqC2IlwVgHrhdeO7w8.jpg\"/></div>"},

Claim 10469 filed 07/0623 for $104,190\n3. Schedule 5269090, seems related to Claim 10469</p>\n\n<p>Searching dockets by &#39;Workday&#39; shows:\nDocket 1058 filed June 26, 2023 which is a response, on behalf of Workday, to a Notice to contract parties to potentially assumed executory contracts and unexpired leases. (Original notice to contract parties is docket 714)</p>\n\n<p>The docket states a few important things: </p>\n\n<p>&#39;On July 3, 2017, Debtor Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. (\u201cBBBY\u201d) executed a Master Subscription Agreement (as amended, \u201cMSA\u201d) with Workday...&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;The Debtors\u2019 Proposed Cure Amount\u2014$104,190.00\u2014correctly reflects the total prepetition balance...&#39; (same amount as Claim 10469)</p>\n\n<p>It also states &#39;Workday reserves all rights with respect to postpetition invoices...including the right to require payment in full of all postpetition \ninvoices&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Copies of postpetition invoices were included in the docket.</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 postpetition invoices, one for $891,918, and the second for $543,973. Total $1,435,891. (Same as claim 10474, and same amount listed on docket 1958 as amount payable, but not yet due, to Workday)</p>\n\n<p>So, we know BBBY had contracts with Workday since 2017, there is a Workday claim for prepetition balance of $104,190, and there is a Workday claim for postpetition invoices totalling $1,435,891. </p>\n\n<p>This doesn&#39;t really confirm if the Debtors plan to continue using Workday or not, or if Workday is just claiming the amounts that they expected to receive based on the service agreement. I just want to provide some additional info about where these numbers come from.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Of course if a single bid is received that is astronomical then this is great. Otherwise, auction is likely most fabourable June 27, 2:30 pm EST</li>\n<li>best bids will be determined by multiple factors including monetary value but also overall value and impact to stakeholders as determined by the company and their consulting parties</li>\n<li>highest/best bid at the end of the bid submission deadline that was earlier today will set the floor bid going into auction</li>\n<li>at the auction, to outbid the previous best offer, it must be increased by at least 2%</li>\n<li>results will be announced at the sale hearing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is my quick takeaway.
