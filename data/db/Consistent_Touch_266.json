Until today I thought rollups had to do with fruit. But here\u2019s my \u201ctoo smooth to know\u201d (TSTK):\n\nChina provided the DIP and the SHFs did not like that because it gave BBBY a chance; so they got Hindenburg to smear IEP hoping this would cause China to withdraw from the \u201cunits\u201d mentioned by Mr. E Barnes. It did not work.\n\nSo today they attacked the need for the DIP as unfair. Not sure why it\u2019s unfair to bet a company won\u2019t fail but that\u2019s what I got.\n\nStrike two.\n\nMr. Glenn got his ass handed to him. The only thing he said that was right is that everyone in the court is against him.\n\nIf any of this is inaccurate, please set me straight either here or on the PP show tonight.\n\nI love this sub and the hive mind!", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Jumping from $0.2 to $8.50 will wreck the options: the gamma ramp and FOMO will propel it above the tender offer \u201cprice\u201d. The BBBYQ shorts need to close which jacks the price up even more.</p>\n\n<p>But as BBBYQ surpasses $9, arbitrage kicks in because IEP needs to be 3x of BBBYQ. By the time BBBYQ hits 30, IEP will sit at an arbitrage value of 90. Bill and Hindenburg know this so they\u2019re trying to close their IEP shorts by either buying 3 BBBYQ or 1 IEP per open short.</p>\n\n<p>Now you have IEP shorts bidding against BBBYQ shorts. </p>\n\n<p>And the really cool thing is IC controls 87% of the IEP shares. If he diamond hands that 87%, then the \u201cvalue\u201d of 3 BBBYQ shares goes up.</p>\n\n<p>I think I need to call somebody\u2019s mom.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I bought my first Jimmies at $380 because I wanted to tell my grandchildren I tried to make the world a better place; I kissed that money goodbye because everybody gets crushed by the establishment.
