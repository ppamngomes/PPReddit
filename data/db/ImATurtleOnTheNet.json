I no longer think RC is involved, I think it\u2019s someone who does not give a shit about anyone or anything, and is the self proclaimed destroyer of shorts. He already became the richest \u2018businessman\u2019 on the planet that\u2019s to the Tesla squeeze, and he now owns a platform where he is actively (intentionally?) destroying its prized brand asset. I think big E wants the shell company to take X public and set fire to the world as the first Trillionaire. RC has morals, and wants the shirts out of the way, but he wants to beat Amazon legitimately. Big E has no morals and wants to be the biggest Big E of all time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Let&#39;s suppose that RC pulls this thing of ours off, and some sort of MOASS happens.  The results being healthy companies that have broken off their shorts. And a loyal investor base. Every successful business venture has lots of copy cats. It&#39;s a standard playbook. The mechanism by which they shake their shorts will be analyzed, scrutinized, and codified, resulting in --- another playbook. Every wannabe RC out there will have a how to break your shorts.
