As always do your own dd this isn\u2019t financial advise. </p>\n\n<p>Okay so we know a couple days ago (on November 2) JAT wrote a public letter to then Overstock recommending the removal of then CEO Jonathan E. Johnson. JAT being a hedge fun which has a 9.6% stake in Overstock. JAT wrote:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe current CEO needs to be removed immediately [\u2026] He has performed poorly (as demonstrated by the company\u2019s financials relative to its peer group), he has communicated poorly with investors and the sell-side community and he has recently taken actions that give the appearance that his own interests are being prioritized.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>JAT didn\u2019t stop there, and also recommended for a certain board member by the name of Marcus Lemonis to become CEO. Lemonis had joined the Overstock board just last month:</p>\n\n<p>JAT wrote:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMarcus Lemonis is clearly the most qualified person available to manage the business,\u201d</p>\n\n<p>All good and dandy, so far. </p>\n\n<p>Yet today we get news of Johnathan E Johnson resigning as CEO, as per JAT\u2019s recommendation? AND Marcus Lemonis popping up on Pulte\u2019s X thread asking Pulte for permission to come up to his NYC meetup celebration. </p>\n\n<p>Curious no? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 \ud83e\udd8b \ud83e\uddf8</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
