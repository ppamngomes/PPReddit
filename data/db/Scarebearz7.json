This gives the applicant the opportunity to secure their rights to the trademark while they are still in the process of launching their product or service.</p>\n\n<p>What\u2019s more interesting is May 12th 2023.</p>\n\n<p>He instructed his lawyers to file UK trademarks for Teddy, 2 weeks into $BBBYQ entering Chapter 11.</p>\n\n<p>Filing date 12 May 2023\nDate of publication 09 June 2023\nTrade mark number UK00003910897</p>\n\n<p>trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/pag\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Product Categories:</p>\n\n<p>Class 20</p>\n\n<p>Furniture; pillows; figurines of plaster, plastic, wax, wood; mirrors; picture frames.</p>\n\n<p>Class 21</p>\n\n<p>Cups; dinnerware; mugs; vases; beverage glassware; figurines of china, crystal, earthenware, glass, porcelain, terra cotta; travel mugs; serving platters.</p>\n\n<p>Class 25</p>\n\n<p>Bandanas; coats; dresses; footwear; hats; headbands; leggings; loungewear; pants; shirts; shorts; skirts; sleepwear; socks; sweaters; sweatshirts; swimwear; T-shirts; underwear; caps being headwear; wrist bands as clothing; jackets (clothing).</p>\n\n<p>Class 28</p>\n\n<p>Dolls; balls for sports; board games; card games; children&#39;s multiple activity toys; infant toys; party games; pet toys; plastic character toys; playground balls; playing cards; plush toys; puzzles; children&#39;s educational toys for developing fine motor, cognitive, counting, coordination spelling, and math skills skills; home video game machines.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting timing of these trademarks is one of the closest indications we have to Ryan Cohen\u2019s potential plans, the UK trademarks being filed add to my unwavering conviction as they display continued interest and pursuance of his activist venture with our investment. </p>\n\n<p>If they were abandoned, I would be concerned, to the contrary they have been filed globally.</p>\n\n<p>Further Connections to use in commerce:</p>\n\n<p>RC Ventures also updated their SIC code to match BBBY\u2019s sometimes in 2022, credit @Beyond_Uranus for this great DD\n reddit.com<a href=\"/r/BBBY/comment\">/r/BBBY/comment</a>\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Logical Deconstruction;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why were the trademarks inactive for 326 days?</li>\n<li>Why were they updated while we are in Chapter 11, not before or after?</li>\n<li>Does this imply he&#39;s going ahead with Teddy?</li>\n<li>Why didn&#39;t he start in March when the standstill agreement ended with BBBY?</li>\n<li>Would he start a new company from scratch? The GMEDD interview stated he wouldn\u2019t?</li>\n<li>Why were the trademarks simply not abandoned?</li>\n<li>Why haven\u2019t they been used yet?</li>\n<li>Why did he tweet work hard or please leave on Mark Tritton\u2019s ousting anniversary?</li>\n<li>Would Ryan Cohen let short sellers and overpaid executives win, while we lose?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One day before the UK trademarks were filed Ryan Cohen tweeted an image, the first sentence was \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!!!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The same day the trademarks were filed he liked a tweet with the words </p>\n\n<p>\u201c@GameStop in Union Square\u201d on a Zelda launch.\nWhat\u2019s $BBBYQ\u2019s HQ address? 650 Liberty Ave, Union.</p>\n\n<p>He rarely likes random Gamestop launches, so the coincidence of those words, the HQ address and filing of the UK trademarks is a fascinating game of probability.</p>\n\n<p>My critical thinking and analysis indicate he is highly active behind the scenes and $BBBYQ shareholders will be made whole and Ryan Cohen will achieve reputation recovery.</p>\n\n<p>We seek infinite reward dangling in the jaws of bankruptcy while un-investors sit idly in a miserable grey twilight embracing risk free and reward free opinions.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/rrefd7wpmeib1.jpg\"/></div>"},
