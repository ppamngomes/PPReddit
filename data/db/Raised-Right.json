Before heading to the office, you&#39;ve got some tough decisions to make; should you wear the gold or platinum Rolex today? And do you take the Range Rover or the Bentley for a spin? Decisions, decisions!  </p>\n\n<p>On your way to the office, you stop at Starbucks to get your $11 Latte. While waiting for your coffee, you catch a glimpse of CNBC talking about Bed Bath &amp; Beyond getting delisted tomorrow. Suddenly, a lightbulb goes off in your head! Nobody shops at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond anymore, and retail stores are failing left and right! Why not short BBBY?  </p>\n\n<p>Once you get to the office you lock in your trade; 50 million shares shorted at $0.10.  50 million shares x 10 cents a share, you&#39;ll easily make the company $5,000,000. What an easy trade.  Imagine the big bonus you&#39;ll get when Bed Bath &amp; Beyond goes to zero, and you are laughing all the way to the bank.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>The following day Wednesday, May 3rd.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond starts trading at $0.04 in premarket the first day on OTC as BBBYQ. By the time you get the office, BBBYQ is trading at $0.05. You&#39;re up 50% in 24hrs! You made $2,500,000 so far. FOMO kicks in, and you decide to double down. Shorting another 50 million shares at $0.05 because surely Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is going to zero.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thursday, May 4th</strong></p>\n\n<p>BBBYQ opens at $0.10 and closes at $0.10 </p>\n\n<p>A $2,500,000 loss  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Friday, May 5th</strong></p>\n\n<p>BBBYQ opens at $0.11 and closes at $0.16 </p>\n\n<p>A $8,500,000 loss  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fast forward one month to June 5th</strong> </p>\n\n<p>BBBYQ opens at $0.26 and closes at $0.24 </p>\n\n<p>A $16,500,000 loss   </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>July 20th</strong> </p>\n\n<p>BBBYQ opens at $0.37 and closes at $0.36 </p>\n\n<p>A $28,500,000 loss.   </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Redditors talk about the stock going to the fucckkinng moon, just like Gamestop. $100, $200, $400, maybe even $1,000 a share - anything is possible. At $100 a share this shitty hedge fund manager will have lost $10 BILLION dollars. At $1,000 a share that would be a $100 BILLION dollar loss.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Not financial advice. Although......  </p>\n\n<p>Once upon a time, there were two brothers named Kingston and Princeton, and they had a very wise mentor named Grandpa Teddy. Grandpa Teddy knew a lot about the stock market, and he loved to share his knowledge with his grandsons.</p>\n\n<p>One sunny morning, Grandpa Teddy invited Kingston and Princeton to his cozy office. He wanted to teach them about the stock market and how to make good decisions with their money.</p>\n\n<p>Grandpa Teddy said with a warm smile. &quot;Today, we&#39;re going to talk about the stock market and an important lesson about not &quot;shorting stocks.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Kingston and Princeton looked curious but a bit confused. &quot;What does &#39;shorting stocks&#39; mean, Grandpa Teddy?&quot; asked Princeton.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well,&quot; explained Grandpa Teddy, &quot;when you &#39;short&#39; a stock, it means you&#39;re betting that the price of a company&#39;s shares will go down. You borrow shares from someone, sell them at the current price, and hope that the price falls later. If it does, you can buy back the shares at a lower price and return them to the person you borrowed them from, making a profit.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The two friends listened carefully as Grandpa Teddy continued, &quot;Shorting stocks can be risky, and it&#39;s essential to be careful. You see, when you&#39;re wrong, and the stock price goes up instead of down, you can lose a lot of money.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But why is it so risky?&quot; asked Kingston?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well Kingston, let me tell you two a story about a greedy Bear, who once tried to short Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&quot;. said Grandpa.</p>\n\n<p>Once upon a time, there was a greedy bear named Kenny who thought he knew everything about the stock market. He had heard rumors about Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and believed the company was going to fail.</p>\n\n<p>He thought he could make lots of money quickly and impress everyone with his financial skills.</p>\n\n<p>Grandpa Teddy continued, &quot;Kenny was so eager to make a profit that he didn&#39;t think about the consequences of his actions. He borrowed 100 million shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond at $0.10 each, thinking that he could buy them back later at a lower price.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Kingston and Princeton were listening intently, knowing that this story was going to have an important lesson.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;However,&quot; Grandpa Teddy said, &quot;the stock market is full of surprises. Just like before, the stock price of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond started to rise instead of fall.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh no!&quot; gasped Princeton, worried about what would happen to Kenny.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; nodded Grandpa Teddy. &quot;Kenny&#39;s plan backfired, and he found himself in big trouble. The stock went up to $0.20, then $0.30, and finally to $0.40 per share!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Kenny&#39;s losses kept growing and growing,&quot; Grandpa Teddy continued, &quot;He lost $10 million, then $20 million, and even $40 million!&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>The young brothers now understood why shorting stocks could be so risky.</p>\n\n<p>Kingston and Princeton&#39;s eyes widened in shock. They couldn&#39;t believe how much money Kenny was losing.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And what happened to Kenny, did he live happily ever after?&quot; asked Princeton.</p>\n\n<p>Grandpa Teddy laughed. &quot;I&#39;m afraid not Princeton. The price of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock kept rising and rising. The price hit $100 per share and then $1,000 and kept going.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So how much money has he lost now?&quot; asked Kingston   </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well&quot;  explained Grandpa Teddy, &quot;When the price was only $1,000 per share, Kenny owed $100 Billion dollars!&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;100 BILLION DOLLARS?!?!&quot; Princeton and Kingston yelled.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Grandpa Teddy, I&#39;m never going to short a stock&quot; said Kingston</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Me either&quot; said Princeton</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>THE END</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

The lessons taught in each one of these books, represent the very important life lessons that Ryan Cohen (RC) was taught by his father - Ted Cohen. Ryan is the founder of the pet e-commerce store Chewy, and currently serves the role as Executive Chairman of the Board for Gamestop (GME). Mr. Cohen was recently appointed as Executive Chairman of the Board for GME on <a href=\"https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/static-files/ba2ade38-8a5f-4e36-9974-94253e6cd305\">June 7th per the 8k filing</a>. The 8k mentioned; &quot;Cohen\u2019s responsibilities will include capital allocation, evaluating potential investments and acquisitions, and overseeing the managers of the Company\u2019s holdings&quot;</p>\n\n<p>While Teddy currently only sells children&#39;s books, it is anticipated to sell much more due to <a href=\"https://uspto.report/company/Teddy-Holdings-L-L-C\">multiple trademark filings</a>.  Many of these trademarks show similarities with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond product lines; Towels, Beddings, Plumbing and Steamfitting Supplies, Hardware, Furniture &amp; Upholstery, etc... These trademarks seem very odd for a company that only sells children&#39;s books. Makes you wonder, is Teddy planning to sell more than just books?

I disagree. In the filings, the exact same address in Wilmington, Delaware is used for all of the Teddy trademarks that I listed above, including the filings with this image. So I don&#39;t think this is a screenshot from an old owner of the Teddy domain. This website looks drastically different from the Teddy website we have now. The website above has no bright colors or art work, no unique logo, etc... I think this was just created to show a proof of concept of what Teddy could look like.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now let&#39;s get into some Teddy Wayback Machine DD/Tinfoil</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The first recorded appearance of the Teddy website with the same logo as the trademark filings was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200812234331/https://teddy.com/\">August 12th, 2020</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qppjsjk9v5db1.png?width=1693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b681ee608c5f35ffd162f7bff459bfaa03c548d0\">https://preview.redd.it/qppjsjk9v5db1.png?width=1693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b681ee608c5f35ffd162f7bff459bfaa03c548d0</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>August 12th?

Why does this matter? Well with this incredibly short timeframe between dates, I find it highly likely that Ryan Cohen had something to do with that old archived version of the website.</p>\n\n<p>Shills scream that was just an old version of the website that has nothing to do with the Ryan Cohen or the Teddy we know now. There is no way RC could&#39;ve turned Teddy into what it is now, if he didn&#39;t already own and manage the domain.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Chapter 2: 300+ retained leases, and partnership with Overstock?</h1>\n\n<p>Shoutout <a href=\"/u/Life_Relationship_77\">u/Life_Relationship_77</a>  and Moonshot for their DD on how many leases BBBY still holds, and updating the count in the comments</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/1531znd/comment/jsi5tmw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/1531znd/comment/jsi5tmw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>To summarize <a href=\"/u/Life_Relationship_77\">u/Life_Relationship_77</a> &#39;s post; There is 306 leases that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is still holding onto. 235 BBBY stores, 68 Buy Buy Baby stores, and 3 warehouses.</p>\n\n<p>But why? Why would Bed Bath &amp; Beyond want to hold onto all of these stores? Could it be that the company plans to emerge from Chapter 11, and they have cherry picked the best possible stores for a new business?</p>\n\n<p>During the hearing on July 11th, an attorney from Kirkland and Ellis literally said: &quot;The debtor still has a path forward out of chapter 11 [...] and will announce a new timeline in the coming days&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So if BBBY does come out of Chapter 11, what will the company be called? Hmmmm, if only there was a new emerging company that had trademarks for all of the same product lines as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond......... TEDDY, ITS GOING TO BE CALLED TEDDY!!!</p>\n\n<p>I suspect that Teddy will move into most all of leased locations, that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond are still holding onto. Teddy will offer all of the same products from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Buy Buy Baby, plus even more. Everything from clothes, games, baby products, furniture, bedding, TOWELS... you name it, they got it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Partnership with Overstock</strong></p>\n\n<p>The IP that was sold to Overstock is actually shared, so it&#39;s not like BBBY doesn&#39;t have anything left. The name Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is now exclusively owned by Overstock, as well as the corresponding website domain. All of the customer lists, customer data, and everything else is shared. If BBBY plans to make it out of Chapter 11, why would they sell their customer data to a competitor? Maybe because the company they sold it to isn&#39;t going to be a competitor, it&#39;s going to be a partner.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect that Teddy and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (once Overstock) will join forces just like how Amazon partnered with Kohl&#39;s. When Kohl&#39;s partnered with Amazon in May 2021,<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kohls-amazon-partnership-2-million-new-shoppers-millennials-2021-3\">Kohl&#39;s drew in 2 million new shoppers</a>. All of those loyal Amazon customers started flocking to Kohl&#39;s to make returns, and those returns led to purchases inside of Kohl&#39;s.</p>\n\n<p>I think the same thing will happen with Teddy and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (Overstock). All of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#39;s loyal customers will follow them to their new website (since they no longer have any stores) and continue to make purchases.  Teddy will act as a physical store for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, where customers can make returns. The biggest upside of this partnership is that Teddy stores will likely display and show case large or expensive items that you can only buy at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (Overstock). Such as patio furniture, couches, mattresses, etc... Customers love to see and feel the product they are buying it before they actually do. This is how Best Buy has done so well despite the rise of Amazon. You offer customer&#39;s the ability to test out the product in store, and then they are willing to go make that large purchase online.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Bonus - Chapter 3: Lego</h1>\n\n<p>Before I sign off, I just wanted to add to some of the Lego tinfoil that I&#39;ve seen the last couple of days. I don&#39;t think anyone has mentioned the Lego Star Wars Yoda at all, from the original teddy website show in the trademark filings .</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/k86alk01w6db1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b343cd8a28a465422f16a45dd7c13235ec08869d\">https://preview.redd.it/k86alk01w6db1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b343cd8a28a465422f16a45dd7c13235ec08869d</a></p>\n\n<p>Lego tweet yesterday, adding to the Blockbuster tinfoil</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ba9xxst8x6db1.png?width=536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7469fa6e24044e98de3ffebbc3aaf4125f8d10ca\">https://preview.redd.it/ba9xxst8x6db1.png?width=536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7469fa6e24044e98de3ffebbc3aaf4125f8d10ca</a></p>\n\n<p>There was also a post someone posted yesterday, about images of Legos appearing in like 20 different pages in Teddy books. I can&#39;t find the post now, but I&#39;ll update this post if I can find it. I suspect it was likely deleted due to possible copyright infringement, as the poster posted many pictures of the Teddy books.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/CXemZuox-3oCOG4_asOwxqB0vHlZJNKcG1dCNRyo980.jpg\"/></div>"},
