In other words, how can RC make a claim that the plaintiffs have nothing to gain (as in,  future tense/ &quot;here on out&quot;), which would include new shares, and then have the case thrown out...only to come back in a meaningful capacity and give us shares in a new company...</p>\n\n<p>Doesn&#39;t that tell us something? If the &quot;deal is done&quot; then RC would be lying by using this argument to throw out the case and then do a 180 immediately following?..I don&#39;t see how that would fly...</p>\n\n<p>Please help me reconcile this if any one can...</p>\n\n<p>Paging <a href=\"/u/jake2b\">u/jake2b</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/9eppp6osxgzb1.png\"/></div>"},
