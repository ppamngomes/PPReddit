A distribution and supply chain, ~300 stores... anything else? Besides Baby&#39;s stuff, obviously.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s been bugging me. If Holly Etlin believes the business will continue, but the IP, assets, most of the stores, and even the Bobby name are gone... along with their membership list... what&#39;s left?</p>\n\n<p>Baby was the profitable portion of Bobby. Baby stores remain. But you don&#39;t need another 300+ baby stores... but what about 300 Teddy stores? </p>\n\n<p>Is Teddy becoming the new Toys R Us? Reverse IPO, inherit 300 stores to immediately begin stocking shelves, with an already established supply chain and distribution network. Selling everything from books to toys to children&#39;s clothing (what a damn money spinner!!)</p>\n\n<p>License out a gamestop section instore, since Bobby stores are pretty damn big, right? Covers kids video games, computer bits, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Does this make sense, or am I missing big bits of information that make this impossible?</p>\n\n<p>The more I think about it, the more I believe limiting the business to just babies is a dumb decision, because children LOVE toys. Talk about delighting your customers, right? Children constantly need new clothes and shoes, too. Being able to take your kids to the toy store that also covers their clothing needs and such will be a godsend for parents. Kids will WANT to go and be trapped looking at school shoes for 3 hours... and in exchange they get a new transformer from the same shop. All at an affordable (delightful!) Price.</p>\n\n<p>As an added bonus, Teddy picks up the pieces of Bobby in the reverse IPO. We get Teddy shares from the merger, 1:1, and Bobby squeezes. RC brings shareholder value while wiping away Bobby&#39;s debt and only inheriting the BEST stores Bobby had. Bobby&#39;s current management staff take over Teddy wholesale, with the Bobby board becoming the Teddy board with RC as non-exec chairman like he was at GME. </p>\n\n<p>Double up the tinfoil layers. Here we go:</p>\n\n<p>How does IEP fit in? Icahn leveraged IEP units as collateral for a buyout, right? The bonds. 80% of the bonds, I believe it was? In RC/RCV&#39;s title. In exchange for funding RC&#39;s buyout, IEP gets a lucrative stake in Teddy, maybe some members on the board, too. Though I suspect Icahn trusts RC based on his track record with Chewy and GME. Icahn likes making performance-based deals, right? Brett Icahn taking over IEP being a great example. Maybe Icahn wanted GME cash flow positive before he&#39;d go forward with RC, which is why the photo of RC+Icahn came out when it did (I believe it was the first Cash Flow Positive quarter, no?) As proof RC could &quot;buy whiskey&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Sigh. There I go again, jacking my own tits. I&#39;m beginning to think I&#39;ve got a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: just checked. Yeah, the quarter RC posted Icahn&#39;s photo was the Quarter GME went cash flow positive. A few days before the end of the quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: the Baby auction being split is super bullish for this case. Rename ALL the Bobby and Baby stores to Teddy. Don&#39;t need the IP side. Just the distribution and commercial aspects of the company (as a going concern ;)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
