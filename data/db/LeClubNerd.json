For reference, Commsec has been one of the safest in Australia to get our US stocks although it&#39;s been a long journey, I went buying my $GME from small brokers like Stake, transferring to Commsec then DRS&#39;ing to Computershare, then booking those shares and buying and DRS&#39;ing more via Wise, buy, book rinse repeat. Commsec however just spent the last few months changing their US partner from Drivewealth to IKBR and during that time wouldn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t DRS anything. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, just thought i&#39;d add to the list of brokers with shares being removed, also of note my EToro BBBYQ shares are still there.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
