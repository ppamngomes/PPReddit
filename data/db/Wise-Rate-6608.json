Travis, I hope you make it through whatever it is you&#39;re going through and I mean that sincerely. I also don&#39;t medicate and push through it. I find that vitamin D and fasting helps tremendously and stopping alcohol also helps, but that&#39;s just my experience. Fasting when I feel it coming has worked 100% of the time, actually. It&#39;s been a miracle.</p>\n\n<p>That said, last night&#39;s show sucked. Allowing Travis to take up what seemed like an hour of time rambling about his mental illness sucked the mood out of the air.

However, that does not mean we should allow it to derail the show. A show like this is for friendly banter and to talk shit and talk about the stonk. Giving someone the floor to take over the show to talk about his depression and let him keep it going for over an hour honestly isn&#39;t the best thing for him either.

I want to bring up some key topics, go through the prod and cons, and explain my thought process behind my own decisions. You can choose whether or not to take my opinion into account when making your own investment decisions.\n\nGoing to try and make this short and sweet for the smooth among us.\n\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK:\n\nMany people are blissfully unaware of the inherent risk of keeping your shares with a brokerage. Brokerage shares introduce \"counterparty risk\" into your position that doesn't exist with DRS. With your brokerage shares, those shares are \"owed\" to you, and your broker can default on that contract. Ideally, your broker will buy those shares and hold them for you- but as we know in the world of NSS this isn't always the case. In a MOASS scenario, any broker with significant short exposure will likely get liquidated, which means YOU get liquidated. This can be mitigated by choosing a broker with a strong balance sheet, but that only reduces the risk, ir does not eliminate it especially considering we cant see their balance sheets.\n\nFurthermore, in the event of a share distribution, there is no guarantee you will receive your owed shares. DRS mitigates this.\n\nWHY KEEP IN A BROKERAGE THEN?:\n\nThere are legitimate reasons to keep your shares in a brokerage. Brokers offer you a lot of convenience and investment tools. In terms of BBBYQ, we are allowed to sell when we want and set a limit order and this functionality is not afforded to those who DRS with AST.\n\nWHAT I AM DOING:\n\nMy risk tolerance is not your risk tolerance. Despite how much money I have invested in this play, I am generally risk averse. I believe this is an asymmetric bet where the potential reward can be 100x or more what I put into it.\n\nThere are two things I want to accomplish with this play: get in at the ground level of whatever RC and co is cooking, and make some $$$ in the process.\n\nI have 2/3 of my shares DRS'd, with plans that these will be my long-term retirement. The other 1/3 of my shares I have with a reputable brokerage that I plan on selling at a moment of my choice.\n\nI want my TEDDY shares and the only way I can ensure I get them is to have shares DRS'd.\n\nDo whatever you want, but understand the inherent counterparty risk and make choices that align with your goals as an individual investor.", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I&#39;m here to help expose it, or at least bring to light some observations- decide for yourself if I&#39;m on to something here.</p>\n\n<p>The new FUD is to downplay anything that comes from BBBY/OSTK social media. And I&#39;ve noticed some interesting patterns when looking at some of the accounts spreading the FUD. Most of the accounts are old accounts, not what we are used to seeing from the shills. I&#39;m going to walk you through my method of vetting these old accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Method: what I look for is evidence that an account has changed ownership. This isn&#39;t always easy, but so far the majority of accounts I&#39;ve looked through trigger one of the following red flags:</p>\n\n<p>1) A gap between posting on meme subs and earlier activity.</p>\n\n<p>2) User stops posting on whatever subs were frequented before.</p>\n\n<p>3) During the meme-posting window, user has a lot of activity on popular reddit subs that wasn&#39;t there before. Read: karma farming and establishing trust/plausible deniability.</p>\n\n<p>4) Activity before the meme-posting is erased completely.</p>\n\n<p>A high percentage of people pushing the &quot;this isn&#39;t BBBY anymore&quot; angle trigger one or more of these red flags.</p>\n\n<p>Decide for yourself whether this has any value to you. For me, seeing so many accounts spread the same message have these similarities is striking. Most normal people don&#39;t buy accounts to use Reddit.</p>\n\n<p>This leads onto the Game Theory portion of this post. Going to break this up using a Q/A format. </p>\n\n<p>Q) &quot;Why would accounts need to be bought when they can be created for free?&quot;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Account age is an important indicator in identifying shills. Buying old accounts establishes trust, as most people likely only look at account age when trying to identify shills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Q) &quot;Why don&#39;t these accounts spread FUD all the time on the meme subs?&quot;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>That would be obvious. The most successful shill campaigns are ones where the people shilling seem like normal investors. Shilling is not successful if you lose credibility.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Q) &quot;Have you seen these similarities at any other time?&quot;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes. The most notable time was the DRS debate on Stonk before it grew legs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Q) &quot;Isn&#39;t it possible that these accounts are legit people?&quot;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Of course. I wouldnt go around calling people shills just because their accounts share some of these qualities. The important part is to recognize the pattern and think critically about why the pattern exists. Most importantly, think of the content and opinions being shared by the user.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\n\n<p>It is important to think critically about the narratives being spread, and idnetify the shift in narrative. Ask important questions. Does it make sense for people to try and push OSTK/BBBY content out of this sub? Why are we being flooded with this narrative all of the sudden? Is this organic behavior, or does it seem orchestrated or forced?</p>\n\n<p>By now, most of us are used to shills being among us, using reverse psychology and other tactics to spread confusion. Ask yourself: why? Why is controlling the narrative on a small sub so important? </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: The accounts being used to spread the &quot;get OSTK/BBBY content out of this sub&quot; have huge red flags that the account may have been bought. The high percentage of these &quot;bought&quot; accounts that are being used to spread this narrative is alarming. These accounts are also using reverse psychology to flip the script and paint the people on the other side of the narrative as shills. Don&#39;t fall for it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
