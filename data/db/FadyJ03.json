There\u2019s still people that till this day think that Jimmy is going bankrupt one day, I think its absurd to even think that. I only see a company with so much potential going forward. They keep saying that PP, regional, Jake and others are making people invest in Bobby and loose their money, In my opinion it\u2019s them, you are the ones that make me buy more of these stocks. I\u2019m 32 and during my whole life no one has ever cared on what I spend my hard earned money, only two people have cared, my mom and my dad. For you to come and bash people and make fun of them because they believe in something, it shows how much of a piece of shit you are. They think they are smarter and to this day they think SHF follow the rules and laws \ud83d\ude02 as soon as I started reading shit like that I knew these people are bought and paid for. We know Bobby is a risk play, I used to spend way more money in scratch offs trying to win something than what I invested in the stock, but to create a sub and spend all your day there bashing other peoples decisions it extreme. I have stock and I barely come to read to see where we are standing at this moment and I can\u2019t imagine you guys whit no positions on those stocks wasting your time, except if they pay you to do so\u2026 it\u2019s the only thing I can think of.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
