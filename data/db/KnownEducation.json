NCSWIC", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The <strong>hundredth monkey effect</strong> is a hypothetical phenomenon in which a new behavior or idea is spread rapidly by unexplained means from one group to all related groups once a critical number of members of one group exhibit the new behavior or acknowledge the new idea. The behavior was said to propagate even to groups that are physically separated and have no apparent means of communicating with each other.</p>\n\n<p>The Great Awakening will involve MOASS, and Wall St. will be broken down to nothing.  The world will learn of the corruption by major industry and government leaders, and will learn that all the markets have been rigged(for some time, see the creation of the federal reserve in 1913).</p>\n\n<p>If you have the eyes to see, the ears to hear,. and the heart to listen, take this:</p>\n\n<p>NOTHING CAN STOP WHAT IS COMING.  Evil will be taken out and the world will learn and heal from the knowledge.  If you hold gme/bbbyq you will be part of the restructuring of the world with evil exposed/removed.   This is a VERY SERIOUS responsibility, which is why we have people like Pulte trying to show everyone how to give back.  Hes doing it early, to plant the seed in all of us to DO THE RIGHT THING. </p>\n\n<p>Enjoy the show folks, this is endgame and we have patriots in control now.</p>\n\n<p>Much love.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
