If anyone knows more about registered accounts and the mechanics lmk, I won\u2019t consider it financial advice anyways idc and I don\u2019t blame anyone for anything, all decisions are my own. </p>\n\n<p>I am unable to transfer shares out of the RDSP because I\u2019d have to do a cash swap which I don\u2019t have the money to do, selling is my only option these fuckers boxed me into. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m worried they probably would choose option 3 to steal all 15k of my bbbyq shares for a penny if I decide to not do anything or wait too long, but wouldn\u2019t that be a major fiduciary breach? Considering they are banksters I wouldn\u2019t put it past them to steal my shares for a penny. </p>\n\n<p>At this point it looks like I\u2019m selling at a ~63% loss, if I sell today. Will wait till end of day or to see what information can be revealed through this post. </p>\n\n<p>I do have 1k shares in a separate cash account (that I also transferred out of a TFSA previously back in June). None DRS\u2019d cuz I\u2019m so broke I can\u2019t afford the fee. :( </p>\n\n<p>So\u2026 how fucked am I? Fucking horrible timing eh?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff4500"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/KD12dpixPS2F-jRrBY2C0j-q68JC5NnNTv9mFlEgmvg.jpg\"/></div>"}]
