August 10th two days after the 382 shift model analysis by various parties back on August 8th, NOL data is then sent to an unspecified M&amp;A team.</p>\n\n<p>IF BOTH THE BED BATH IP <strong><em>AND</em></strong> THE BABY IP WERE GONE A MONTH AGO WHY IS THERE AN M&amp;A TEAM THAT NEEDS <strong><em>NOL TAX DATA</em></strong> ON AUGUST 10TH!!?!?!?\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80</p>\n\n<p>Ahem\u2026 apologies. </p>\n\n<p>Here is a concise timeline of events with sources for those of you who wish to look for themselves. </p>\n\n<p>July 6th 2023 //Docket 2654// Page 275: Erin Tucker prepares and initiates a 382 shift roll forward. </p>\n\n<p>August 8th 2023 //Docket 2654// Page 329: </p>\n\n<p>Megan Sullivan bills for tax trial review for 3 hours, <strong><em>382 shift</em></strong> analysis then looked at by Erin Tucker. She then has it discussed with several others and the debtors are billed for emails regarding it. </p>\n\n<p>Immediately after this there were about 10-15 phone calls made to various BBBY state tax offices regarding collecting information on taxes for 2022 (I don\u2019t have a pic but you can look I\u2019m doing this one section from memory forgive any inaccuracies)</p>\n\n<p>August 10th 2023 //Docket 2654// Page 334:</p>\n\n<p>NOL data for 2022 fiscal year reviewed and NOL carryforward info sent to <strong><em>MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS TEAM</em></strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Megan Sullivan then goes on to collect info regarding viable/depreciating assets, which is done in this context to further maximize NOLs. This is august 10th people. If there was an ownership change that triggered rule 382 they would know by this date, her doing this I believe is more further proof that they know the NOLs are viable to be spun off and were trying to milk every last drop after learning that fact. </p>\n\n<p>I fully believe the NOLs have been spun onto Baby and Baby has been acquired. Pair this with 4.5% ownership shareholders being frozen and rushed cancelation which all are actions that would need to be taken to preserve NOLs? Excitingly bullish. </p>\n\n<p>Last slide is more things I found that I think should be brought to light. </p>\n\n<p>Confidential litigation mentioned and 1800+ litigation hours billed? </p>\n\n<p>Accelerated share repurchase related billing as late as September 1st and 8th, <strong><em>a press release</em></strong> to go with said ASR and all major billing ends on the 14th?

Originally last week I was told that my shares were still held on the back end but weren\u2019t visible but was now told that the DTC has called back all shares since they\u2019re \u201cworthless\u201d and as do the plan to date \u201cshareholders weren\u2019t getting anything\u201dand every share is gone from my broker because of that. I tried to explain the difference between \u201cno value\u201d and \u201cworthless\u201d and didn\u2019t get anywhere, she refused to use my wording despite repeatedly explaining it to her as well as the meanings, my guess because the call is recorded.</p>\n\n<p>My next line of questioning moved to my eligibility for new equity should there be a distribution to past shareholders. The management member I spoke with confirmed that because across all brokers the shares were forcibly removed and sent to the DTC my broker no longer had record or affiliation with BBBY and if there was some kind of equity issued she said most likely it would be done in a way through BBBY itself and I would probably have to provide them with trade confirmations, statements of proof of ownership up until 09/29/23 rather than have shares poof into my account one morning.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s just so magically coincidental that the stock suspected to be grossly oversold gets a DTC memo for brokers to remove all shares and now I\u2019m told my broker wouldn\u2019t be responsible for new equity distribution as they no longer held a position on anyone\u2019s behalf and all the shares are back with the DTC. </p>\n\n<p>I have since printed several copies of all my statements with months of purchase, trade/order confirmation, signed and dated all pages and am going to put them in safe deposit boxes. Either the DTC is telling brokers this to cover all their asses as well as themselves or shares were recalled to be counted for equity distribution through blockchain or something.</p>\n\n<p>No idea if we\u2019ve been fucked and brokers are trying to save themselves or we\u2019re about to be on the moon with ease, rather than have to get new shares from BBBY directly and god knows what that process would be like. </p>\n\n<p>I need wrinkles here stat to analyze, confirm or debunk what this lady was telling me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "TRUST ME BRO", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ea0027"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I can feel it, the excitement just hasn\u2019t hit me yet. I\u2019m actually really looking forward to watching candles first day we start trading, seeing that price action live is gonna be SO cool. </p>\n\n<p>A word for the wise, given the share price this is suspected to reach I would purge your accounts of any mention of how many shares you own. I don\u2019t have that many and I still have refrained from publicizing anything to do with my exact number of shares as I don\u2019t want my net worth calculable nor do I want to make an absurd amount of money. I\u2019ll sell enough for a nice house and money to travel and eat well for the rest of my days but I\u2019m not shooting for a net worth that puts my life in danger. Plus HODLing for the sake of it is funny to me, I\u2019ll chuckle as we break 4 figures knowing the higher the price goes the less I want to sell, I\u2019ll just use it for dividends after the squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the money\u2026</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s about sending a message.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>FUCK YOU. </p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b                \ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b            \ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b              \ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b       \ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b              \ud83e\udd8b        \ud83e\udd8b    \ud83e\udd8b           \ud83e\udd8b \ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b       \ud83e\udd8b             \ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b                        \ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b           \ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b                      \ud83e\udd8b              \ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b                     \ud83e\udd8b                 \ud83e\udd8b        \ud83e\udd8b</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\udd8b                     \ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b           \ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b    \ud83e\udd8b   \ud83e\udd8b    \ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b        \ud83e\udd8b        \ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b                     \ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b                     \ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b\n\ud83e\udd8b                     \ud83e\udd8b          \ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
