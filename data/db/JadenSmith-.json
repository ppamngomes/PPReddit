Here&#39;s a quick list of what I&#39;m aware of - if some people could please fill me in on details or where I might be misunderstanding things that would be great - thanks in advance!  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dockets/Board have revealed the current &quot;plan&quot; for emerging from CH. 11 stating that shareholders will not receive compensation</li>\n<li>Dockets/Board have stated the &quot;effective date&quot; for this plan to be on or around Sept. 30th</li>\n<li>The plan can be amended up until the effective date to include shareholder compensation </li>\n<li>The plan can also be changed after the effective date? (iffy on this, I&#39;ve read conflicting information?)</li>\n<li>The PP show in Pulte&#39;s office was filled with good tinfoil (some people mad over this because of their own faulty timeline expectations) </li>\n<li>Likely RC (or Icahn) referenced in most recent dockets as &#39;activist investor&#39;</li>\n<li>RC recently confirmed elected CEO of Gamestop</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s pretty much what I&#39;ve gathered of recent events - I guess currently my biggest question is if the amendment to the plan is actually 100% necessary prior to the effective date?   </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
