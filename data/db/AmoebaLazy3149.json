Had stock, options, and bonds cause diversification. Seems like a quiet day so here is a new update on the situation, 2024 bonds are now zero on Firstrade. Not sure what is happening but SOMETHING is happening at least?</p>\n\n<p>*Quick update: seems like there is a opposite post saying they got filled for 2024 bonds, and they are trading at 0.95 on IBKR (0.95 cents to the dollar). Definitely not tradable yet on Firstrade, not even searchable.
