DK Butterfly shows up as the new name for what is left of BBBY.  There\u2019s been plenty of Tin Foil about butterflies.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking about what a butterfly represents.  It is a very common tattoo that represents transformation, freedom, rebirth.</p>\n\n<p>While Butterfly could just be a random name, I don\u2019t believe it because it ties in too much with the path of Bed Bath and Beyond.</p>\n\n<p>So to start, Bed Bath and Beyond has been a successful company over the years and has a place in many\u2019s hearts.  It\u2019s well documented how bad leadership and short selling has been a detriment to the company.  Ryan Cohen saw the beauty in the company and specifically in its crown jule Baby.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see in the image.  Butterflies have a cyclical life.  It begins with a butterfly laying an egg.  What is interesting is that this egg turns into a caterpillar that ends up protecting itself in a cacoon before it can develop wings and fly.</p>\n\n<p>So, the original butterfly who has been trapped by debt and ABL loans laid its egg.  The cocoon was formed around this company (chapter 11 protection).  The cocoon also represents the past of BBBY, eventually the shell must be removed as the butterfly grows wings and flys.</p>\n\n<p>I wish I had better writing ability and could make this more poetic.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I just think the name Butterfly represents something beautiful.  Why would you name a liquidating trust something beautiful if it was just wiping out shareholders and selling off remaining assets?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/f1ij4jzv0frb1.jpg\"/></div>"},

Here&#39;s a breakdown of the key points:</p>\n\n<p>1) Bond Prices: The idea lies in the fact that bond prices haven&#39;t seen the same bounce as stocks since bankruptcy. This could be due to factors such as most bonds being locked up and a lack of liquidity affecting their price and demand.  If someone secretly owns these they don\u2019t care about the prices currently because they know there is a large payout.  Illiquid means they are locked up.  I would expect more volatility if these were being traded.</p>\n\n<p>2) NOLs (Net Operating Losses): If someone acquires the corporate structure of Bbby with a plan to operate the same business, they could take advantage of the NOLs. The updated debt/liability vs. assets will provide a clearer picture of the company&#39;s financial standing. If Teddy is behind the DIP (Debtor-in-Possession) loan, they might be able to obtain the company&#39;s equity at a low cost or potentially a net positive due to NOLs and the sell off of Bed Bath and Beyond.  Teddy could also take some of the remaining leases to get started, but I don\u2019t think they need a lot.  Could they buy 1 for example and continue to sell Bedding, towels and baby gear to get the NOL benefit?  That\u2019s an extreme example but just shows that little of the actual physical assets matter.</p>\n\n<p>3) Relentless Retail Base: Teddy possesses a valuable asset in its loyal retail customer base. If Cohen utilizes the stock for the company, it can gain instant popularity and liquidity. This can lead to the stock trading at high valuations and provide easy access to capital for company development.</p>\n\n<p>Based on these factors, merging with BBBYQ&#39;s Shell could provide Teddy with an equity structure and a ticker symbol, enabling it to tap into BBBYQ&#39;s existing popularity and liquidity. Additionally, it may allow Teddy to take advantage of its NOLs and potentially acquire the company at a low cost, possibly including some desirable leases.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

There was a bidder for the IP, now we wait to see if the theory is right about someone using what\u2019s left asset wise to give birth to Teddy.\n\nIt\u2019s scary that it\u2019s come to this as the final option, but it\u2019s also what everyone has dreamed of (no pun intended).  I\u2019m not going to put odds on it but am just going to wait it out and see what happens.  I have a few thoughts that are keeping me bullish.\n\n1) Teddy\u2019s new trademarks aren\u2019t all for baby projects, in fact most of them have more in relation to Bed Bath which has sold its IP off already.  So if Cohen is starting Teddy, it doesn\u2019t make much sense for him to keep Baby as a going concern.  It makes more sense to sell the names.\n\n2) Dream On Me is a current vendor for Baby.  They are getting the name of Buy Buy Baby to increase their brand awareness, but are not going to compete with a company like Teddy.  Rather they would most likely have a section within Teddy where they sell the quality rebranded Dream On Me Products under the name Buy Buy Baby.  This sets up well to be a subsection within Teddys ecosystem.\n\n3). Related to the point above, dream on me is paying more than half of their revenue for intellectual property.  This really doesn\u2019t make sense, and I can\u2019t see how they can afford it.  Maybe Cohen has backed them to buy the IP and they become the future Baby Registry for Teddy?  Just a thought.  \n\n4).  Bbby has cut down its debt dramatically and still we haven\u2019t seen updated numbers since the leases were auctioned.  If NOLs can be taken advantage of it\u2019s possible the shell BBBYQ could be used almost like a SPAC to get the equity structure, store footprint and existing infrastructure going for Teddy.  Although it would need some work, it\u2019s cheaper than building it all from scratch.\n\n5). To utilize the NOLs the company has to continue operating in a similar fashion.  Someone had a post earlier today about RC Ventures \u201ccan\u2019t remember\u201d code being the same as BBBY\u2019s.  Also most of a Teddys trademarks match the existing companies business identically.\n\n6). The last reason is the retail investors he ends up with.  Yea there will be an influx of new investors if this happens.  However he will have a core that had so much trust in him that they held though BK and constant FUD.  What a way to build an investor base. \n\nMany of you don\u2019t want to hear this but I don\u2019t see Overstock and Bed Bath being a major part of this.  They have their nitch, but Overstock has a brand that is unsold retail selling for cheap.  I don\u2019t think Cohen would want Teddy directly involved with that, but I could see some synchronicities in Teddy not holding on to inventory long and having a deal with Bed Bath to Sell it online.", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Reading the filings it\u2019s evident that it is for IP.  Overstock actually over paid from what BBBY estimated their IP at in their recent 10k.</p>\n\n<p>One thing is weird to me.  Bed Bath has a lot more tangible assets that were not sold in the \u201cBed Bath\u201d Auction today.  Warehouses, merchandise, logistics.  So the question is when will that be sold?</p>\n\n<p>They have a separate auction for their leases, and then on for Baby assets only.</p>\n\n<p>You can\u2019t tell me nobody bid on the rest of Bed Baths assets.  I believe they actually weren\u2019t for sell.  Things are starting to make sense to me.</p>\n\n<p>Overstock buys the IP, which generally Bed Bath as we know it would need to continue using a lot of their trademarks etc.</p>\n\n<p>However, Bed Bath doesn\u2019t technically need to own their IP\u2026 they can license it through Overstock.</p>\n\n<p>This allows a quick upfront cash injection by Overstock, in which Bed Bath pays back over time during the restructuring.  See image above page 49, it talks about valuing the asset as a cash flow as if they were licensing it from another company.  This seems to be fairly common in corporate America.</p>\n\n<p>My gut feeling is we will see Bed Bath continue as a going concern and maybe see some type of partnership with Overstock to get rid of a lot of the \u201cOverstock\u201d assets that Bed Bath has.  A lot of the Tritton brands can be sold through Overstock, and Newell and West Point Brands can begin to sell using a more lean Bed Bath Physical footprint.</p>\n\n<p>We will see what happens to Baby, but I think we will see Sixth Street buy baby for the Debt to Equity that leaked last week.

I\u2019m not an accountant, but I will give my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>The NOL\u2019s are listed as Not more likely than not.  Meaning BBBY legally stated there is Not more than 50% chance they will be used.  Maybe legalise but they stated in a weird way that also means it\u2019s not less than a 50% either.  Every step in chapter 11 (not allowing 4.5% holders to sell) has led to the idea that this NOL is being held as an asset.  Which would mean Share Holders are safe!</p>\n\n<p>Another note is to David Simpson.  I don\u2019t follow him on Twitter unfortunately but know he was looking at liabilities vs assets.  I believe he was using and NOL number that was about half what the new 10Q showed.</p>\n\n<p>The operation losses in the end seem to be purposely done to take advantage of this credit.</p>\n\n<p>Also, to put the value of the NOL into perspective.  If it was hypothetically distributed to share holders then the SP would be around $1.  This is an incredible asset for a buyer.  </p>\n\n<p>Would be interested on David\u2019s or others stocks.  Seemed like we were already close to being net positive and still waiting for what BABY brings.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m feeling optimistic.</p>\n\n<p>Bonus note:  let\u2019s say HBC or an entity is holding 311 non voting shares.  This effectively retains almost 50% of the company.  So if a buyer owns it, then buy acquiring the rest they can pretty easily retain the NOLs.</p>\n\n<p>Also, IMO there\u2019s no way there are more than 120 million shares outstanding in the open market!  Volume is way to low and there\u2019s way too much retail.  My theory is a lot of\nThe 749 million is locked up/ in treasury/ held closely.  These shares also can\u2019t be sold until a restricting plan is released.  If someone is holding these, which to me it looks like, then share holders are part of the plan.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/mystlvtg0z6b1.jpg\"/></div>"},

Again all these are speculative but just some different avenues.  To me these would be worst case, I definitely don\u2019t think they are more probably than us squeezing the shit out of shorts and going on Tour with Pulte and T Swift next summer.</p>\n\n<p>1).  Take a look at sears as an example.  It\u2019s been a long drawn out bankruptcy in which the restricting plan was f\u2019d up by lawyers.  Several years and law suits later there is a chance share holders will get a pay out.</p>\n\n<p>IMO if Gove and company truly ran us into the ground while diluting massively then there will be a lot of pissed share holders and lawyers looking to make a buck.  I keep going back to the EToro interview and the evidence in the filings that bankruptcy papers were being worked on in Dec-Feb.  I also look at how big of a lie we were told that we\u2019d go bankrupt if we couldn\u2019t do the R/S vote and then not even holding the vote.</p>\n\n<p>There is clearly some fuckery if this company just falls apart and liquidates.  It wouldn\u2019t be sexy but I think share holders would get atleast $50 million from potential lawsuits.  </p>\n\n<p>So based on 739 million that could be .15 cents a share.  Could obviously be a huge range based on what\u2019s uncovered but I don\u2019t thing $50 is a stretch.</p>\n\n<p>2) The cohen class action.  We will see what happens there, I believe it\u2019s on hold during bankruptcy.  However if cohen is not involved anymore, there could be some leniency from a judge to help out share holders who got screwed.  I think that was in the 60 million range that Cohen would potentially pay back to share holders for the pump and dump.</p>\n\n<p>So really what I\u2019m trying to say is current SP could be a low as far as how share holders will make out. </p>\n\n<p>I hope none of this happens, but hope it eases some of you that there are options to recover some money if they end up wiping out Share Holders.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Lawyers are working around the clock to figure out a way to make as much of the company a \u201cgoing concern\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Now the bears will take a look at the assets vs debts and since assets are less immediately say Shareholders are wiped out.  However that is far from true.</p>\n\n<p>The Stalking Horse bidders being reported only seem to want Buy Buy Baby.  It is bullish that someone has said they would potentially do an equity deal to keep it a going concern at 75%.  This would be a great outcome for Baby, and would them allow them to focus on growing.  This fits into what Cohen proposed in his letter (Reread his letter and he doesn\u2019t say he wants direct ownership). He may have someone else buy it and then partner with Teddy.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s apparent that Buy Buy Baby is a beast.  CNBC reports that Babylist registries increased by 200k since Bed Bath filed.  Holy shit.  200k x 12 months is 2.4m registries a year.  Let\u2019s put about $5000 per registry on average.  (Probably more because Babylist is a boutique online shop planning a physical showroom in Beverly Hills)</p>\n\n<p>Thats over a billion in only baby registries!</p>\n\n<p>For Babylist their company is based on registries.  Buy Buy Baby has several other avenues for income by being a brick and mortar retail.  This 1) allows new parents to shop and understand the quality.  2) Allows new parents to go into a nearby store and use a scanner to create their registry. Beats doing it online or flying to California to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Ok now on to my main point of this thread.  Bed Bath and Beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Well it\u2019s not fully liquidating yet.  From the outside looking in it appears that a full wind down is happening.  If you look harder though a lot of bad locations and leases are being shredded.  In addition everyone in there mom loves a going out of business sell.  BBBY is clearing old inventory and right sizing their physical footprint.</p>\n\n<p>They have many types of debt.  When people see 5 billion in debt they make the assumption that it needs to be paid back immediately.  However it doesn\u2019t.  The sell of Baby should allow for a restructuring of Bed Bath and Beyond to take place.  The two may then have separate owners but could still fall under a future Teddy umbrella.  Bed Bath can start filling their store with Newell goods as they restructure and get back to the brand everyone loves.</p>\n\n<p>So I don\u2019t think BBBY is just going to disappear like MSM wants you to think.  There is too much name value here.  </p>\n\n<p>IMO the shareholders have a good chance to make it through alive.   Hopefully we receive some equity in Baby as well as get some sort of direct investment in BBBY as is.  There are many different scenarios that can play out.</p>\n\n<p>Gove was talking about 2030 and having females in power positions.

Let\u2019s look at two possibilities of the dilution.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last couple months ~400,000,000 shares have been added to the O/S.  We are now at 558,735,983 per the S-1.  This is as of April 10th when the stock price was .30 cents.  It has now dropped to .238 cents.  It\u2019s likely more shares have been added since April 10th so I\u2019m going to calculate MC based on the .30 cent number puts us at at MC of $167,000,000.</p>\n\n<p>So bears have been crying dilution and bulls have been thinking maybe these shares are being held by someone somewhere and not necessarily hitting the market.</p>\n\n<p>Option A:  shares have been hitting the market and it\u2019s pure dilution.  Price reflects this as we have gone down consistently for about 2 months.  BBBY is getting barely anything for equity and absolutely screwing current shareholders.  Because of the negligence they need a R/S because they are out of authorized shares.  (Honestly if this is happening I see law suits in Sue\u2019future).  Negligence, but who knows wall street will cover it up.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway based on Option A shares are flooding the market to the tune of 5x in 2 months.  To sell ATM somebody is buying them.  Is it MM\u2019s?  Is it shorts trying to get out of positions (No, SI has stayed within a million this entire time).  It\u2019s not insane to think retail is buying these shares in this scenario\u2026 </p>\n\n<p>60k followers on this Reddit.  Meaning it would take each member an average of a $2800 investment.  Now there are a lot of bots in that number, but there are also a lot of people with much higher investments.  I know people putting in their bi weekly paychecks.  I know others with $100,000+ and ABC had mentioned he knows of people with 7 figure positions.</p>\n\n<p>In that scenario it is very possible that Retail owns the entire market cap of the company.  I would find it hard to believe they don\u2019t own atleast half the market cap.</p>\n\n<p>Option B). Is interesting and could mean the available float is much less than the O/S.  Now it\u2019s impossible to say that some of the shares have been hitting the market.  The last known tradeable float we know of is 114 million on Yahoo.  This number Varys, but let\u2019s say it\u2019s 200 million ( they\u2019ve diluted some to the market, and have a few holders holding the rest)</p>\n\n<p>Ok in this scenario the MC of shares available to purchase is much less.  Assuming the 60k holders it would take each owning $1000 of BBBY stock!</p>\n\n<p>The fact that our MC is so low is amazing.  Retail should have the ability to move this.  However we are seeing volumes of over 70% daily traded in dark pool.  We have also seen fidelity data of 90% buys on the lit market.</p>\n\n<p>We have no idea how many shorts / naked shorts there are.</p>\n\n<p>What we do know is something is F\u2019d up here.  It doesn\u2019t add up.  The only thing that makes sense is that there is illegal naked shorting going on in order to drive this to bankruptcy.  Say what you want about the companies fundamentals, it doesn\u2019t matter.  If Retail wanted BBBY to be $1 billion dollars they could easily do it with the 60k Reddit users putting in less than an average of $10,000.  </p>\n\n<p>We are in a situation where the value of the retail investor is getting swallowed by illegal Mm manipulation.  So I do think there is someone who got themselves in trouble here.  They didn\u2019t know the power of retail.  Let\u2019s see how it plays out..</p>\n\n<p>THE STOCK PRICE IS FAKE!!!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
