Since then I have gotten no less than 10 DMs asking why. Most clearly have a nefarious intent in reaching out, but a few were genuinely interested in why I am so confident in this play. After much dialogue, I thought it might be best to just share my confidence as a post.</p>\n\n<p>While I enjoy reading all the great DD and investigative inquires you apes put together, my confidence is held solely in Ryan Cohen. \u201cWait, what? RyAn SoLD aNd LeFt ApEs HoLdInG tHe BaG!\u201d Or you can fill in the response with your favorite doomer \u201cRyan is out\u201d comment. While the sockets seem to be a bit contradictory, I am still 100% confident even if he did sell. But why? Great question\u2026let\u2019s discuss it.</p>\n\n<p>First and foremost, I enjoy studying people. I have worked in sales for nearly 30 years, so it\u2019s my job to discover what makes people tick. Why do they do what they do? What motivates them? You see, behavior is driven by desire - so it stands to reason that if you want to know why Ryan does what he does, you need to understand his motivation.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, so let\u2019s look at the PuMp AnD dUmP he is accused of. First off, Ryan is not a dumb guy. He knew that with his strong base of GME investors, if he bought a substantial stake in BBBY, many apes would follow. And we did in large numbers. Many mirrored his January 23 options, even to the tune of $80 strikes (guilty myself). </p>\n\n<p>So let\u2019s say he did change his mind and sell off everything and leave BBBY and all interest behind. In the process he made about $110M, leaving his followers holding the bag. Not a bad payday, huh? Even for a billionaire. We know have the perfect narrative to turn the apes against their fearless leader. </p>\n\n<p>But not so fast, now let\u2019s talk about Ryan\u2019s motivation. Why did he do that? While there are certainly some ruthless billionaires out there, this behavior doesn\u2019t match his character. If money was his motivation, why work for free? Why call out others that make money at the expense of retail to only do it yourself? </p>\n\n<p>The truth is that Ryan doesn\u2019t need $110M. He could buy a secluded mansion somewhere and never work another day of his life. He has all the money he could ever need. What motivates Ryan is his legacy. This is clear in his communication, his actions, and what he is building in the memory of his father. Why in the world would he take the black eye this would leave over money he doesn\u2019t need. Even at worst, he could have dropped $12M at the auction and got a piece of BuyBuyBaby to bail out his reputation. That\u2019s a small price to pay when you got $110M and left your legion holding the bag.</p>\n\n<p>That is why I am 100% confident in this play. Ryan isn\u2019t out. It\u2019s against his nature and would be a black stain on his legacy\u2026one that he is building in the memory of his father. Now couple that with another billionaire <a href=\"/u/pulte\">u/pulte</a> who has also tied himself to this play by coming on the PP Show and you\u2019ve got two that are staking their reputations on BBBY. Pulte could have easily continued to support and praise Ryan through GME, but he purposely came to us, knowing that would now tie his name and his great family legacy to BBBY. You don\u2019t do that unless you\u2019re confident in the end game. And that my fellow apes, is why I am. See you in Valhalla!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
