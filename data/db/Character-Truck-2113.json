(the \u201cCompany\u201d) and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany Parties\u201d) filed a voluntary petition (the \u201cChapter 11 Cases\u201d) under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d). On the Petition Date, the Company Parties filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to jointly administer the Chapter 11 Cases under the caption \u201c<em>In re: Bed Bath, et al.</em>\u201d Certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries were not included in the Chapter 11 filing. </p>\n\n<p>The Company Parties continue to operate their business and manage their properties as \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Company Parties filed with the Bankruptcy Court motions seeking a variety of \u201cfirst-day\u201d relief, including authority to pay employee wages and benefits and to pay vendors and suppliers for goods and services provided both before and after the Petition Date. In addition, the Company filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking approval (\u201cInterim DIP Order\u201d) of debtor-in-possession financing (\u201cDIP Financing\u201d) in the form of the DIP Credit Agreement (as defined and described below). </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>DIP Credit Agreement</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>Subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court following the entry of the Interim DIP Order, which the Company expects to receive, the Company Parties and Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., Sixth Street Lending Partners and TAO Talents (the \u201cDIP Parties\u201d) have agreed to enter into a senior secured super-priority debtor-in-possession term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $240,000,000 subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (the \u201cDIP Credit Agreement\u201d). If the DIP Credit Agreement is approved by the Bankruptcy Court as proposed, the DIP Lenders would provide a senior secured super-priority debtor in possession term loan facility (the \u201cDIP Facility\u201d), consisting of (1)\u00a0a new money single draw term loan facility in the amount of $40\u00a0million, and (2)\u00a0a roll-up of certain secured obligations under the existing prepetition credit agreement between the Company Parties and the Prepetition FILO Lenders in the amount of $200\u00a0million. Borrowings under the DIP Facility would be senior secured obligations of the Company and certain Company Parties, secured by a super priority lien on the collateral under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August\u00a09, 2021 (as amended by that certain First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August\u00a031, 2022, that certain Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Waiver, dated as of February\u00a07, 2023, that certain Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Waiver, dated as of March\u00a06, 2023, that certain Fourth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Waiver, dated as of March\u00a030, 2023, that certain Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Waiver, dated as of April\u00a06, 2023 and that certain Sixth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, Consent and Waiver, dated as of April\u00a021, 2023, the \u201cExisting Credit Agreement\u201d), as well as all unencumbered assets of the Company Parties (subject to customary exceptions). The DIP Credit Agreement has various customary covenants, as well as covenants mandating compliance by the Debtors with a 13-week budget, variance testing and reporting requirements, among others. The proceeds of all or a portion of the proposed DIP Credit Agreements may be used for, among other things, post-petition working capital for the Company and its subsidiaries, payment of costs to administer the Chapter 11 Cases, payment of expenses and fees of the transactions contemplated by the Chapter 11 Cases, payment of court-approved adequate protection obligations under the DIP Credit Agreements, and payment of other costs, in each case, subject to an approved budget and such other purposes permitted under the DIP Credit Agreement and the Interim DIP Order or any other order of the Bankruptcy Court. </p>\n\n<p>2 </p>\n\n<p>The DIP Credit Agreement is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, which has not been obtained at this time. The Company Parties are seeking (i)\u00a0interim approval of the DIP Facility and availability of a portion of the DIP Facility in the amount of not less than $240\u00a0million at an interim hearing in the Bankruptcy Court, contemplated to occur on or about April\u00a024, 2023 and (ii)\u00a0final approval at a final hearing in the Bankruptcy Court. The Company Parties anticipate that the DIP Credit Agreement will become effective promptly following entry of the Interim DIP Order by the Bankruptcy Court. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Item\u00a02.03.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an</strong> <strong>Off-Balance</strong> <strong>Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The information set forth under Item 1.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K regarding the DIP Credit Agreement is incorporated herein by reference. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Item\u00a02.04.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Triggering Events that Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an</strong> <strong>Off-Balance</strong> <strong>Sheet Arrangement.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Senior Debt Events of Default</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constitutes an event of default that accelerated the Company\u2019s obligations under (i)\u00a0the Existing Credit Agreement and (ii)\u00a0the Indenture, dated as of July\u00a017, 2014, as amended by the First Supplemented Indenture, dated as of July\u00a017, 2014, relating to the 3.749% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the \u201c3.749% Senior Notes\u201d), the 4.915% senior unsecured notes due 2034 (the \u201c4.915% Senior Notes\u201d) and the 5.165% senior unsecured notes due 2044 (the \u201c5.165% Senior Notes\u201d and, together with the 3.749% Senior Notes and the 4.915% Senior Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d) between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. </p>\n\n<p>As of the Petition Date, the Company had an aggregate of (i)\u00a0$1,029,900,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, (ii)\u00a0$80,284,905 outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement, (iii)\u00a0$102,632,790 in outstanding letters of credit and (iv)\u00a0$547.1 in principal of the Prepetition Term Loan Agreement. </p>\n\n<p>Pursuant to Section\u00a0362 of the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases automatically stayed most actions against the applicable debtor, including actions to collect indebtedness incurred prior to the Petition Date or to exercise control over the applicable debtor\u2019s property. Subject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases also automatically stayed the continuation of most legal proceedings or the filing of other actions against or on behalf of the applicable debtor or its property to recover on, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the Petition Date or to exercise control over property of the applicable debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estates, unless and until the Bankruptcy Court modifies or lifts the automatic stay as to any such claim. Notwithstanding the general application of the automatic stay described above, governmental authorities may determine to continue actions brought under their police and regulatory powers. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Series A Convertible Preferred Stock</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constitutes a Bankruptcy Triggering Event, as defined in the Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, dated as of February\u00a06, 2023 (the \u201cCertificate of Amendment\u201d) of the preferred stock, as a result of which mandatory cash redemption provisions contained in the Certificate of Amendment are triggered. In addition, the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases triggers a holder\u2019s ability to convert the preferred stock at the Alternate Conversion Price, which could result in a conversion price of lesser than $0.7160. </p>\n\n<p>This description of the terms of the preferred stock contained in the Certificate of Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Certificate of Amendment, which was filed as Exhibit 3.1 to that certain Current Report of Form 8-K filed by the Company on February\u00a010, 2023. </p>\n\n<p>3 </p>\n\n<p><strong>Item\u00a05.02</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Appointment of Chief Financial Officer</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>As previously disclosed on the Current Report on Form\u00a08-K\u00a0filed with the SEC on February\u00a06, 2023, the Company appointed Holly Etlin to serve as Interim Chief Financial Officer since February\u00a02, 2023. On and effective as of April\u00a022, 2023, the Company appointed Ms.\u00a0Etlin as Chief Financial Officer to serve in accordance with the bylaws of the company until her successor is duly elected and qualified or, if earlier, until her successor has been duly elected or until her death, resignation or removal. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Item\u00a07.01.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Regulation FD Disclosure.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Press Release</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>On April\u00a023, 2023, the Company issued a press release in connection with the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Nasdaq Delisting Notice</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Company expects to receive a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) that the Common Stock is no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5110(b) as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. If the Company receives such notice, the Company does not intend to appeal Nasdaq\u2019s determination and, therefore, it is expected that its Common Stock will be delisted. The delisting of the Common Stock would not affect the Company\u2019s operations or business and does not presently change its reporting requirements under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Additional Information on the Chapter 11 Cases</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>Court filings and information about the Chapter 11 Cases can be found at a website maintained by the Company\u2019s claims agent Kroll LLC, at <a href=\"mailto:BBBYInfo@ra.kroll.com\">BBBYInfo@ra.kroll.com</a>, (833) 570-5355 (U.S. or Canada), or (646) 440-4806 (International).
