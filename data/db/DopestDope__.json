Some ideas/features I think Elon is going to implement are pretty genius.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You will be able to buy stock on X, all these purchases will have an option to DRS seamlessly and easily. i.e blockchain a.k.a loopring.</li>\n<li>After buying whatever stock you will have channels/categories to *blank* stock. These categories will include Official Company Filings, News Articles, AND A COMMUNITY CHANNEL. (You will find The PP show there)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here is where KAIS MAALEJ comes in. He will not be part of The PP Show unfortunately but off to bigger and greater things for himself.</p>\n\n<p>KAIS MAALEJ will be X&#39;s new stock news reporter. He will dig in deep and dirty and get the real news while providing comedic relief. Like come on, wasn&#39;t his latest Jim Cramer video the absolute nuts? Bill Pulte told him to trademark his name....I wonder why? He keeps saying &quot;Kaaaaisss Maaleeejjjj, I love that name.&quot; *I see talent in him as a news reporter/tv personality personally*</p>\n\n<p>Bill Pulte is a very smart man. He see&#39;s the power and potential of The PP Show and what it could become.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

They got charged $7 million....yeah I know right cost of doing business. But what if this time it is different? By paying the fine they admitted to basically being guilty. Could this not come back to bite them later on in the actual MOASS court case against them? Could the SEC be building a stronger case against them by doing this?  </p>\n\n<p>I could be totally wrong but just a thought I had. Anyway, let&#39;s see what comes Monday!

WAIT WHAT?! Yes, you heard that right 0%. So I contacted my broker to find out why (wealth simple).</p>\n\n<p>Finally after a couple weeks I have gotten the answer.</p>\n\n<p>These scum bag brokers are circumventing the high borrow fees for their stupid SHF friends by INSTEAD lending out your shares for a SET percentage of the posted collateral the borrower gave. Which for me was 1%\u2026..</p>\n\n<p>Just another grift I thought I would pass on. Seems like it doesn\u2019t matter if the borrow fee is high, they will find a way not to pay it.</p>\n\n<p>Ps: broker was wealth simple</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
