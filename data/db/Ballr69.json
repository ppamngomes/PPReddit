So I think their goal has been to beat as many people out of bobby leading up to the end while also scaring the general public so that when the time comes they won\u2019t have to fight as much Fomo while closing shorts.

One would think our zero or hero Bobby plays are now locked in? Aren\u2019t they a week late with this blitz? </p>\n\n<p><em>THE ANSWER</em>\nThey are now exposed and want to limit the bleeding. As soon as the \ud83e\udd8bshare reissuance is confirmed and it hits the market in the next few days, they must close ALL shorts (this is a fact). And to survive and close as cheaply as possible they need retail to be disoriented and late to the game. They need us to fomo in after they get out so they can pass off their bags to us later. They also want you to be uneducated about HOW HIGH this motherfucker can rip so you get too excited and paperhand early. They\u2019ve tried to wear us down so much that we will be happy to sell for small gains. </p>\n\n<p><em>THIS IS NOT A DRILL</em>\nNFA- Get your game plan set, get ur dough ready and start telling friends and family to do the same (remember some brokers require settled funds if we are in OTC). You don\u2019t want to be late to the party when butterfly starts melting faces. An educated community gets to set the share price and I am ready to retire. watch houstanwade drop some knowledge: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/2swQ7Wvy7pc?si=0krnsW0PehnUiw2Y\">https://www.youtube.com/live/2swQ7Wvy7pc?si=0krnsW0PehnUiw2Y</a></p>\n\n<p><em>ITS TIME TO FUCKING SEND IT.</em></p>\n\n<p>Ballr out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
