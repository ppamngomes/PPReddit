As such, plans proposed by BBBY&#39;s legal teams were thought to have shareholders&#39; best interests in mind, since the drivers of the plan were those whose interests were written into the plan confirmation and voting process, i.e. the DIP and FILO parties.</p>\n\n<p>The DIP, FILO, roll-up lenders were deemed to make a full recovery. Consequently, these parties were deemed to accept the plan, thereby removing their need to vote just as shareholders of the company&#39;s common stock were deemed in advance to reject the plan and thereby not allowed to vote since the plan indicates shareholders will receive nothing. Alas, both claimant categories were not entitled to vote because their respective recoveries and corresponding vote records were treated as albeit certain, except: enter the waterfall recovery plan.</p>\n\n<p>DIP lenders <em>did</em> get to vote, via the waterfall recovery mechanism because authorizing the waterfall recovery method rendered them less than whole, unless I&#39;m recalling incorrectly or misinterpreting the Chapter 11 plan structure. Bondholders were initially deemed to reject the plan since their recovery was estimated to be zero. However, due to the waterfall recovery mechanism, bondholders were invited to vote because their 2.5% potential recovery from the waterfall recovery mechanism made them the fulcrum security holder.</p>\n\n<p>Well, bondholders voted to reject the plan (See Docket Item 2140), but since the DIP and FILO parties were not made completely whole by way of their acceptance of the waterfall recovery plan, <em>they were able to cast votes;</em> the results of which resulted in a net approval of the current Chapter 11 plan.</p>\n\n<p>So if Sixth Street is representing the private and/or activist investor team behind the pro-shareholder long-play, <strong>I am not able to explain how Sixth Street was able to help broker the original Chapter 11 plan while also laying in await to be a key party involved in the approval or execution of a post approved Chapter 11 plan</strong>, unless my understanding is completely off (most probable) or unless Sixth Street didn&#39;t help consummate the current Chapter 11 plan.</p>\n\n<p>Seriously, if you haven&#39;t read every page of the exhibits in Docket Item 2140 and claim to be in the know on this case, you need to press pause and go back through it. Look at the amounts vs numbers with respect to the percentage accepting vs rejecting the plan. Look at how the numbers and amounts voting to accept vs reject vary between each BBBY subsidiary. For instance, some BBBY subsidiaries include votes from Class 6 claimants to vote, whereas other do not. This reply isn&#39;t meant to be a polished DD post but, rather, my point is to press the point home that we don&#39;t know as much as we represent to know, and that&#39;s okay, but let&#39;s spend less time celebrating and more time working.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Paddling Whale \ud83d\udc0b ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/sQe1fZWGZl6oh8-C7ym8wl1DHaQzq1GFABqshUdFZTU.jpg\"/></div>"},

Riley Stock Down ~50% in Relation to Losses on Franchise Group (ex-$FRG) Acquisition &amp; Securities Fraud Lawsuit: A Quick Look Back on the Legal Players Involved", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Shares of B. Riley Financial Inc. were trading at around $41 a share one week ago, whereas today the stock price closed at $22 per share. B. Riley served as the <a href=\"https://brileyfin.com/blog/b.riley-securities-serves-as-sole-bookrunner-for-bed-bath-beyonds-1.025bn-public-equity\">sole bookrunner</a> for BBBY&#39;s public offering of  Series A convertible preferred stock and warrants back in early February of this year, which yielded $225M initially plus an estimated $800M in future capital at the time. By the end of March, Gove had stated that, &quot;<em>We have raised\u00a0$360 million\u00a0of equity capital since the beginning of February, cured our default under our credit agreement, repaid material amounts of our ABL facility, completed our interest payment for our senior notes, all while jump-starting our turnaround plans</em>&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.abfjournal.com/dailynews/bed-bath-beyond-enters-committed-equity-facility-with-b-riley-principal-capital/\">Source</a>). </p>\n\n<p>B. Riley&#39;s losses this week are reportedly the result of unrealized investment losses and S&amp;P Global Ratings&#39; downgrading of B. Riley&#39;s key asset, Franchise Group. Per Oguh (2023) at <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/b-riley-shares-plummet-after-taking-losses-franchise-group-deal-2023-11-13/\">Reuters</a> today, &quot; </p>\n\n<p><em>S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded Franchise Group&#39;s credit rating on Friday, dropping it further down in junk status to &#39;B-&#39; from &#39;B&#39; with a negative outlook, citing its weak performance. The rating agency also said it was monitoring legal developments relating to Franchise Group&#39;s Chief  Executive Brian Kahn, who led the August take-private deal [of FRG]. Bloomberg reported this month that Kahn is one of two co-conspirators named by co-founder of hedge fund Prophecy Asset Management John Hughes, who this month pleaded guilty to securities fraud.</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>Bryant Riley, B.Riley&#39;s eponymous CEO, said during an analyst earnings call last week that it had invested in Franchise Group based on the fundamentals of the business and that Kahn had no  &quot;direct experience with what has been alleged.&quot; B. Riley has also been targeted by a short seller. In February, Wolfpack Research accused the company of not cutting losses on &quot;failing&quot;  investments and continuing to extend capital to distressed clients.</em></p>\n\n<p>About three months ago, I made a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/15yncvu/disturbance_in_the_force/\">post</a> that got little commentary about B. Riley&#39;s acquisition of Franchise Group, the main reason being the degree of overlap among the financial players involved was odd to say the least. More specifically, the same B. Riley that served as the only bookrunner for BBBY&#39;s public offering of the Series A Stock and Warrants in February of this year, who is also the same B. Riley that&#39;s a member of the Options Clearing Corporation whose <a href=\"https://www.theocc.com/company-information/member-directory\">membership</a> is specific to its rights to participate in the OCC&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.theocc.com/Clearance-and-Settlement/Stock-Loan-Programs/Stock-Loan-FAQs\">Stock Loan Program</a>, acquired the Franchise Group just six months after it worked on BBBY&#39;s offering. There is more detail in my post about the overlap of legal teams used (Wachtell et al., Troutman et al., Willkie et al., Sullivan et al., and Jeffries LLC), but this is Franchise Group in a nutshell:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/89dqe1crv60c1.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f353ca58589b907cb4a24152b92cc0bb19474b68\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/89dqe1crv60c1.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f353ca58589b907cb4a24152b92cc0bb19474b68\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/89dqe1crv60c1.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f353ca58589b907cb4a24152b92cc0bb19474b68\"></a></p>\n\n<p>So we&#39;ve got two home furnishing companies and the entity that owns Sears under Franchise Group&#39;s umbrella, wherein the deal involving B. Riley&#39;s acquisition of FRG included five of the same legal teams that are involved in some way in BBBY&#39;s Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceedings. Are we to think there is no connection between these events and the players involved? Curious what others think looking back on it now in light of more recent developments. </p>\n\n<p>Just a side note; B. Riley also used its B. Riley Principal 150 Merger Corporation to acquire FaZe Holdings Inc. (FAZE) , popular esports and entertainment company, in June of 2021. B. Riley took FaZe public in July of 2022. The stock hit a high of about $17 by early September, fell below a dollar by the end of January, and now trades at $0.20. Last month, FaZe was acquired by GameSquare and added to its eSports portfolio. I mention this transaction because it serves as an example of B. Riley either taking a company public or bookrunning a company&#39;s public offering, where after the company it supposedly believes in gets devalued into BK or acquired. </p>\n\n<p>If nothing else, and even if we&#39;re on track for a successful outcome now, I think it&#39;s important to understand any and all forces that are or were at work along the way. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Paddling Whale \ud83d\udc0b ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Qp2GY7QnqB5CvrYAEqNFaM0Ltilbyftq-tSlCp4bwYg.jpg\"/></div>"},

We Don't Know for Sure Yet", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I love to have my tits jacked as much as the next fella, but felt obligated to make a post about tempering our expectations. I just responded to a comment from <a href=\"/u/Real_Eyezz\">u/Real_Eyezz</a>, who accurately pointed out that we don&#39;t know for sure which Brandon Meadows and which Addison Holdings go together, if any. </p>\n\n<p>In my post last week, I <em>speculated</em> the Brandon Meadows I found on LinkedIn could be the $10B claimant Brandon Meadows. It was also speculation as to whether the Brandon Meadows I found on LinkedIn works at the Addison Holdings LLC located at <a href=\"https://addisonholdings.com\">addisonholdings.com</a>. LinkedIn Brandon Meadows appears to work in Montgomery, AL. There is an Addison Holdings, LLC in Alabama, but it sure doesn&#39;t look like much according to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Addison+Holdings,+LLC/@33.530195,-86.7828958,17z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x88891baabc965247:0x6fdd2cf67aaec86d!2sAddison+Holdings,+LLC!8m2!3d33.5303873!4d-86.7828585!16s%2Fg%2F11f3m8cf73!3m5!1s0x88891baabc965247:0x6fdd2cf67aaec86d!8m2!3d33.5303873!4d-86.7828585!16s%2Fg%2F11f3m8cf73?entry=ttu\">Google Maps</a>, not to mention it appears to be shut down. Then again, there was Alameda Bank, so who knows - lol.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8uofrhrpiexb1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9774cc8e1124fa0391fe85d501436cb5b4400818\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/8uofrhrpiexb1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9774cc8e1124fa0391fe85d501436cb5b4400818\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/8uofrhrpiexb1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9774cc8e1124fa0391fe85d501436cb5b4400818\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The fact that the Brandon Meadows I referenced from LinkedIn <em>appears</em> to reside in Birmingham combined with there being a record of Addison Holdings, LLC existing in Birmingham, does make it seem probable on the surface those two are in reference to each other. As of yet, I can&#39;t find a link between the Brandon Meadows I referenced on LinkedIn and the Addison Holdings, LLC in Park City, UT (the one with the <a href=\"https://addisonholdings.com/\">website</a>), so any linkage between them is not yet substantiated. Brandon Meadows&#39; background and experience on LinkedIn <em>seems</em> to align well with Addison Holdings LLC in Park City, but I can&#39;t prove anything and, even if I could, I can&#39;t prove its the $10B B.A.M.</p>\n\n<p>Addison Holdings out of Park City appears to be a branch of Addison Holdings LLC in California per <a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/companies?jurisdiction_code=&amp;q=addison+holdings+llc&amp;type=companies&amp;types_of_data_held=Branch+Relationship&amp;user=true&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93\">OpenCorporates</a>. There are multiple subsidiaries in it, four Addison Holdings LLCs in different states, but it&#39;s weird because the named state, jurisdiction state, and state of registration are all different in some cases. For example, Addison Holdings-Florida LLC shows it under the jurisdiction of OH and registered to the Addison Holdings LLC in UT, so no relationship to FL other than what&#39;s stated in the name.</p>\n\n<p>There is also one <em>Dream Addison Holdings LLC</em> (TX jurisdiction but registered in NY)) which originated in January 2023. But still no confirmatory linkage yet between the Brandon Meadows I referenced on LinkedIn, the Addison Holdings LLCs in Park City, and the Brandon Adam Meadows on the $10B claim. Regardless, the $10B claim is both provocative and bullish to me because it suggests a massive fish has entered the waters, with both inventory and capital. I can&#39;t explain it or what&#39;s going on, but it&#39;s what I think. In the meantime, I want to keep things honest and felt it was important to reiterate any connections between $10B Brandon, LinkedIn Brandon, and <a href=\"https://AddisonHoldings.com\">AddisonHoldings.com</a> remains to be proven. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Paddling Whale \ud83d\udc0b ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mAt3CNrehHdCxWckI01hrWSXqMGe3ElQsLG2P8oHjpA.jpg\"/></div>"},

Moreover, $2M divided by 63 employees breaks down to about $32k per employee. I received a relocation package of $5,000 in 2006 for moving out of state as part of a promotion with a company that was absolutely crushing it and on the Fortune 1000 list at the time. My director-level position only managed 5 managers, 40 employees, and three locations, plus you have to factor in inflation. </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, $32k on average for 63 employees strikes me as being sizeable, especially when the company was in dire financial straits and barreling toward Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As such, it made me wonder if these moves were made to get key people in specific locations. In Docket Item 10, there is mention of a Wages Motion, wherein the relocation expenses are explained in greater detail, but I can&#39;t find it anywhere. Anyway, after seeing 63 employees received what appeared to be noteworthy relocation packages, I recalled that only 65 employees remained employed full-time:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gdu4vfqgjlwb1.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a8759e1898c07f3020fce8cd376c86b2f9344d5\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/gdu4vfqgjlwb1.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a8759e1898c07f3020fce8cd376c86b2f9344d5\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/gdu4vfqgjlwb1.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a8759e1898c07f3020fce8cd376c86b2f9344d5\"></a></p>\n\n<p>So it got me wondering what the likelihood of the 65 encompassing some or all of these 63 employees.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Paddling Whale \ud83d\udc0b ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/AFJc2NAP9yOArWqurSGHeJEv0kGLUixQ2SNXv4CxL-o.jpg\"/></div>"},

It is all too obvious at this point how much the sub has changed for the worse, however, I was curious how many posts and comments were from users who participated in the share count tracker initiative at some point. Granted, not all participants in the share count tracker initiative were verified, but it still seemed like a reasonable shill filter, just for some perspective. </p>\n\n<p>I only looked at the past 24 hours of posts and comments on the BBBY sub, so admittedly not a strong sample size, anecdotal at best. Nonetheless, I found it interesting that out of the 35 posts in the past 24 hours starting from about an hour ago, that 26 were posts from people who never participated in the share count tracker. Interestingly, quite a few of these were posting screenshots of their liquidated positions and/or comments with customer service reps at their brokers. I was thinking some people are more inclined to weigh-in in the presence of a negative stimulus than a positive one, so maybe that&#39;s part of it. Nonetheless, only 9 out of 35 posts were from sub members who participated in the share count tracker. </p>\n\n<p>The comments were even more of a shit show. Out of 134 comments, 115 were from people who didn&#39;t participate in the share count tracker. Not all comments were negative but, for the most part, I would say they were either negative, lacked substance, or only contained a stupid little catch phrase, i.e., RC will save us, shorts are fukt, etc. It sucks the OG BBBY sub is a dump now. I hope the PP Team adopts the point of view that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure given that we&#39;re seeing a huge uptick in pointless posts.

Could this event be unique in that it will create a record exposing the extent of naked short-selling, rehypothecation, FTDs, and other forms of fuckery among banks, brokers, dealers, market-makers, clearing agencies, introducing brokers, etc., sort of like mapping the chain of custody from the bottom-up?</p>\n\n<p>I mean if JPM was willing to sell a billionaire like Ryan Cohen millions of IOUs instead of buying real shares until they were forced to when he sold, then who knows what kind of shit they&#39;ve pulled on us retail mongrels. Again, perhaps THAT&#39;s the data we need to measure the totality of it. If some entity, be it DK-Butterfly or some other acquirer were to offer shareholders $0.01 per share or one new share for every 100 BBBY shares held, all that information of record regarding the cancellations would need to come out to facilitate such a transaction. </p>\n\n<p>The most logical counterpoint to this being a possibility is that how could it be the first time this is happening given the long history of manipulative market practices and cellar-boxed stocks? I don&#39;t know, but I still wanted to throw it out there because maybe there isn&#39;t any other way for anyone outside &quot;the club&quot; to see this kind of information without taking it on the financial chin. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Paddling Whale \ud83d\udc0b ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/49DpXBz4r4oRDEUi1iwvQH5UHfsYOESGPREKhIyj5HA.jpg\"/></div>"},

About four weeks ago, I flew out of state to help my mom move and get her old house on the market. She&#39;s a tough old bird at 69 but obviously needs help and I didn&#39;t want her paying ridiculous amounts of money for packers, movers, and repairmen when I could get out there and help. </p>\n\n<p>Got home about two weeks ago but, since my own lease was up and our landlord jacked-up our rent by almost 40%, we needed to get a new place STAT. We were able to find a new place and are nearly finished moving in. However, after returning home, we got some pretty bad news that my girlfriend of 12 years has HER2+ breast cancer that may have spread to her lymph nodes and liver. She&#39;&#39;s only 39 years-old and is incredible healthy and fit - doesn&#39;t make any sense to me at all and I&#39;m still in shock. </p>\n\n<p>The last two weeks have been jam-packed with MRIs, PET scans, CT scans, biopsies, etc. She starts chemotherapy next week - suppose to last about 4-5 months. Next comes radiation, then bilateral surgery, followed by antibody treatments, and ongoing tests to achieve remission. We find out before chemo if it&#39;s hit her liver, which would put her at Stage IV and reduce her chances considerably. </p>\n\n<p>I miss the share counts and ongoing engagement with the PP Show and BBBY sub, and was glad to hear from so many people asking why the share counts stopped and if I jumped ship. Still here and holding strong. Life is a trip - hug and kiss your significant others, kids, and parents.

I am flagging positions as verified if someone provides proof substantiating at least half their position size. Why? Because there is a trade-off - make positions verifications too much of a pain in the ass and participating will suffer, whereas setting the verification bar too low will all doubt to creep in regarding the integrity of the share counts. The thought process is that, if someone is willing to go through the trouble of verifying the majority of their position <em>and</em> their post and comment history isn&#39;t suspect, there is little reason to doubt the unverified portion of their position is made-up. </p>\n\n<p>It is also very important that everyone knows the ~58M shares that haven&#39;t been verified yet are not unverified because of any holders&#39; unwillingness to verify but, rather, I simply haven&#39;t reached out to request verification. Moreover, and this is on me, there are a lot of people (hundreds) who did post screenshots verifying their positions early on but I simply was not set up to delineate verified and DRS&#39;d shares at the time. My apologies for that; shoulda, woulda, coulda. Moving forward and as a call to action, this is an open invite for all shareholders with positions at or below the xxx,xxx level to direct message me with verifications of their positions if willing. </p>\n\n<p>I only have two x,xxx,xxx shareholders I haven&#39;t verified yet, both of which probably verified at some point and I either missed it or they subsequently deleted it before I began distinguishing verified vs unverified shares. I&#39;m in the process of reaching out to these two individuals directly for verification. Since nearly half of the xxx,xxx shareholders are verified, please reach out with a direct message via chat to confirm you&#39;re verified if you&#39;re unsure whether you are or include in the message a screenshot to verify. </p>\n\n<p>Last thing, please understand that I&#39;m respectfully asking people to verify, not telling anyone what to do. Your shares are your business, period. However, I also want to strive for as much trustworthiness and accuracy as possible across the share count updates, hence the request. Thank you to all who verify proactively and to those willing to verify moving forward. </p>\n\n<p>As always, whether you&#39;re already on the share tracker and want to update your count or report a new position, please reply to this post with the total number of shares you hold. This tracker started on May 4th. If you weighed-in with your share count at some point before this date, your shares are not included. Anyone who wants to participate but do so privately, or if your comments aren&#39;t going through because you don&#39;t have enough karma, you can message me directly anytime via chat in Reddit.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, between share count updates, you can share an update to your position any time by responding to any post or comment from me, no matter what the context or how old the post. And all types of updates are encouraged, including position decreases, to help keep the counts as accurate as possible.</p>\n\n<p>In case there are shareholders among us who want to participate but do so without any connection to Reddit, you can also email me at [<a href=\"mailto:paddlingupshitcreek@gmail.com\">paddlingupshitcreek@gmail.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:paddlingupshitcreek@gmail.com\">paddlingupshitcreek@gmail.com</a>).</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I am flying out of town to help my mom move for the next two weeks, then return home to move my own fam. Fucking landlord increased our rent by 53% when our lease expired month before last, so we&#39;re on the hunt for a new place. As such, I may be slow to respond, so please don&#39;t interpret that as me ignoring anyone&#39;s efforts to participate or verify; just slammed is all. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Paddling Whale \ud83d\udc0b ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/088z2ltgzyPe25fgC_GvEd2jqKU34-1Z_NSy7pEXEGc.jpg\"/></div>"},
