Plus this is all taking place across 4 different networks of communication: Reddit, YouTube, X, discord so it\u2019s even worse trying to keep track of who said what and where and was it recorded?!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I want to start off with 2 things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>much respect for what you are doing in this community. </p></li>\n<li><p>and that I think our different points of view on this topic likely won\u2019t matter in the end. We both agree that something is coming before Oct 20.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After reading your response, I think you have it 95% correct. But an early error in your reasoning (or mine) takes us to a different conclusion with the same facts. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m going to quote your response quite a bit to respond to specific parts in order and let\u2019s see if we can sort this out. </p>\n\n<p>Jake-\n\u201cCorrect me if I am wrong but the jist of what you are saying is that the OCC is in the dark and the conclusions I made are too far-reaching.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Me-\nI would say that the OCC can\u2019t operate on tinfoil or even probabilities and only relies on SEC filings. They can only act on what is declared. Much like what is happening with the brokers currently. They don\u2019t know that something is about to happen because they aren\u2019t watching that part of the story. They are only reacting to filings. </p>\n\n<p>Jake-\n\u201cthey are advancing the options to the monthly expiration date, but why? How can they, unless they know that there will be action before that date?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Me-\nI think this is the exact spot were we take different paths. </p>\n\n<p>They are advancing the options because the action has already happened. The action was that the shares were \u201ccancelled\u201d on the effective date of Sept 29th. </p>\n\n<p>This action set in motion the OCC\u2019s standard protocol for settling options where shares are no longer available. </p>\n\n<p>First - Cash settlement only. Shares don\u2019t exist, so any value has be delivered in cash. </p>\n\n<p>Second - No shares means no trading. Get it off the books by accelerating the expiration. </p>\n\n<p>We actually agree on the rest of your post. </p>\n\n<p>Jake-\n\u201cUnless I am misreading, you are asserting that they are choosing October 20 &quot;just because.&quot; But what if that were too early?</p>\n\n<p>I believe it is because it was not random. Further, in the OCC memo they cite specific rules and by-laws from their own Charter and these citations are not vague at all. I&#39;m failing to see (and would love your you to elaborate so I can better understand your position) how you assert the action they took is from a point of confusion, they chose October 20 and even though they cited Section 11, Section 11A, Rule 807 and Infomemo 23707, that none of these apply to the reasoning they chose October 20.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Me- \nIf we look at the shares being cancelled as the action, the Oct 20th date is still the correct date for the acceleration based on Section 11, 11a, Rule 807 and infomemo 23707. They all absolutely apply to the reason the date is Oct 20th in both of our hypothesis. </p>\n\n<p>Are they too early? I absolutely believe that they are early. But they allow for that in the memo disclaimer: \u201cAdjustment decisions are based on information available at the time and are subject to change as additional information becomes available or if there are material changes to the terms of the corporate event(s) occasioning the adjustment.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Now I don\u2019t know what happens if we get no new information before Oct 20th. I don\u2019t expect this to be the case anyway and that\u2019s probably a different conversation. </p>\n\n<p>Like I said in my initial comment, I think exercising Puts right now is also early. In fact I think it helps my argument that if the OCC expected or knew of a distribution/settlement they would not allow brokers to be exercising puts. That\u2019s leaving the hedge unbalanced.</p>\n\n<p>It would be like a bookie paying out the winner at halftime. The bookie would only do that if they thought the game was over.</p>\n\n<p>If I were a broker and heard that the companies transfer agent say \u201ctrading is halted pending further corporate instructions\u201d I\u2019d be shitting my pants. </p>\n\n<p>But they don\u2019t know that, because they haven\u2019t asked. </p>\n\n<p>Those puts will have to be rolled back. </p>\n\n<p>So like I said at the beginning. We agree. </p>\n\n<p>We agree that something else is coming by Oct 20. We just believe that for different reasons.</p>\n\n<p>To use the OCC memo as evidence of that, I believe is a mistake. And I believe that you\u2019re the type of person who wants to make decisions on true information, good or bad. </p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
