My account is set to fully transition by November 6th. Will my &quot;worthless BBBYQ&quot; shares as TD called them come over to Schwab still. I only held 178 shares in my Schwab but had 14,211 shares in TD. Do you think my shares will still come over to Schwab when we get our new shares of the company? Any ideas welcome. I have screen shots of my share counts and the TD removal date as proof in case If I get screwed and need to hire a lawyer to fight for my money from TD/ Schwab platform transition. I only DRS 250 of my position.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
