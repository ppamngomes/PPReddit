Note that the business must continue after its reorganization and not become liquidated to experience relief. This implies that a company MUST continue to operate post-Chapter 11 plan to be granted related relief. If they do not reemerge and restructure, all claims must be legally settled. </p>\n\n<p><strong>We now have image 2</strong> \ud83d\udcf7</p>\n\n<p>This leads us nicely to our second image, which confirms this point from another source that you can find here. \u2b07\ufe0f</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Reorganization FAQs <a href=\"http://arklatexlaw.com/practice-areas/bankruptcy/chapter-11-bankruptcy-reorganization-frequently-asked-questions/\">http://arklatexlaw.com/practice-areas/bankruptcy/chapter-11-bankruptcy-reorganization-frequently-asked-questions/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Let&#39;s get to image 3</strong> \ud83d\udcf7</p>\n\n<p>Docket 1713 (a rather crucial one for us all) from BBBY further explains what Chapter 11 is. Take note of the <strong>&quot;reorganization&quot;</strong>. They are not stating a liquidation plan. </p>\n\n<p>This is an important part - they want to invoke the discharging of claims and debts held against the business, which would not be provided to them if this was not deemed a plan of reorganization. </p>\n\n<p>With only the best of the best representing them in this case, I&#39;m sure they are all too aware of the distinction.</p>\n\n<p>For anyone about to argue what&#39;s left of the business to purchase, I will explain this and the law requirements around such.</p>\n\n<p><em>Image 4</em>* \ud83d\udcf7</p>\n\n<p>This is taken from docket 1716. Section 6 distinctly references reducing or discharging their debts via the plan and the possibility of seeking additional financing or investment once the plan has become effective. </p>\n\n<p>For BBBY to commence with any further steps, the plan must have become effective with the conditions stated within. What you will also find is that by the effective date of the plan, the released parties also become free and clear of these claims. </p>\n\n<p><em>Except Mr Cohen</em> \ud83d\ude02 and the other stated non-released parties. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Image 5</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a final parting image on this post, please take note of the avoidable transfer clause found on the US court website.</p>\n\n<p>This part of the post is entirely speculation. Perhaps reaching, however, a possibility that by not releasing Ryan Cohen by the definitive terms of the plan, the allowance of invoking the avoidable transfer clause remains intact. \ud83e\udd14 </p>\n\n<p>To summarise and speculate on the above information now (if you&#39;re still with me \ud83d\ude02)</p>\n\n<p>The plan of <strong>reorganization</strong> (not liquidation) and our shares being cancelled - becoming effective was necessary for the business to emerge from Chapter 11. This is an indisputable fact. I could go further into detail. However, I won&#39;t bore everyone to death.</p>\n\n<p>The main question remains whether the company will honour and reinstate the historic shareholders. With the related relief of the NOLS being such an attractive prospect to any purchaser and the aired possibility of an activist investor wanting to bring justice to the corrupt financial system, my instincts would undoubtedly lead me to a positive conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>My original theory on the Sixth Street and Icahn involvement is undoubtedly still very much in play for me, and you can find my previous post if you are interested in my perspective on this. I do have further updates to this - however, I cannot currently be bothered to attempt to articulate this in a post \ud83d\ude02</p>\n\n<p>This case has some of the biggest names in the industry involved and on the payroll of BBBY. Attention to detail has always been required to deal with such a complex process, and I trust the assembled team. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s always been a fuck around and find-out play, and I&#39;m certainly here for it. </p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\udd13</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/zPg1HX1BSFl6KAPrGr2O2x4ThiSNMGoTsoxyIIIpyPA.jpg\"/></div>"},

What I like are details and things that I peruse that I find &quot;interesting&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the things I&#39;ve delved into certainly align with my original theory and I could be entirely wrong on this branch of my thesis - however it&#39;s perhaps worth covering, just in case it&#39;s not entirely fucking clueless \ud83d\ude02</p>\n\n<p>From my understanding, Sixth Street never actually came good on the rumour of their potential offering for the bbby assets. However from my reading, they themselves would be able to potentially benefit from the NOLS due to the matter currently being processed through BK which lifts a lot of the normal restrictions related. (There&#39;s a much finer set of details to that statement but I don&#39;t want to side track into it in this post.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/swifthoot\">u/swifthoot</a> rightly reminded me that around 2/3 (apologies I&#39;ve watched a lot \ud83d\ude02) court hearings ago we heard how bbby had been in a &quot;successful engagement(s) with Sixth Street&quot; and were optimistic that they had a &quot;positive path&quot; going forwards with the aforementioned. </p>\n\n<p>As exciting as a person that I am \ud83d\ude02 I&#39;ve been monitoring Edgar for varying search terms - some close to home and others broader, multiple times per day for the last few weeks. Personally I like to keep an eye on every player or &quot;speculative player&quot; in the game, in order to decide my thesis or strategy when it comes to my money. </p>\n\n<p>Yesterday I came across the note offering that Sixth street had filed with the SEC. Interestingly enough there were crucial elements missing - for example the cost and quantity of the offering to name a few pretty major details. All that we did see was $.  Millions - so it&#39;s not exactly a tiny deal being pursued.</p>\n\n<p>What was included in this filing though, were the limitations on who could &quot;actually&quot; purchase the notes - limited mostly to the US and Canada. (They certainly don&#39;t fancy just anyone buying them \ud83d\ude02)</p>\n\n<p>We also have some crucial details such as the transfer agent changing from Wells Fargo to computer share... Perhaps just a nothing detail but certainly everyone seems to be liking computer share of late \ud83e\udd28</p>\n\n<p>Today we have the supplemental statement showing $300 million of which the dividend interest will begin from August 14th and mature by 2028. The spread for these is relatively high - but so is the interest of 7% - certainly a high risk, high reward play for the daring purchaser.</p>\n\n<p>It was on this document that I found a crucial date relating to their prospectus of January 13th 2023. A little\ud83d\udca1pinged when I came across this date - regarding the pitchbook info for BBBY also dated - you guessed it January 13th...</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s continue on tenuous coincidences - jumping into the filing of January 13th we have Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton receiving their copies of the filing. Again we&#39;ve very recently seen the employment of this firm by... Well you guessed it BBBY also. On this matter a simple explanation could be that they are highly regarded, but still another coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>Something that Sixth Street mention multiple times, is their investment strategy into middle market companies who are in a financial sticky spot - we can all agree that BBBY would fit this description. Collectively we could call this a &quot;basket&quot; of sorts...</p>\n\n<p>We are all aware and remember the Hindenburg and Icahn war of late and the very catchy statement regarding Icahn-  &quot;Planning to do something they&#39;ll never forget.&quot; \ud83e\udd4a</p>\n\n<p>Well as of yet it almost seems like empty words...unless we just haven&#39;t been thinking expansively enough in our theories. </p>\n\n<p>Icahn purchasing BBBY seemed like a decent recipe for this, but what&#39;s one squeeze compared to swooping a whole trolley full of them at the same time? We can&#39;t miss the correlation between IEP stock and BBBY and there&#39;s certainly something brewing with regards to a change of control and power of the markets. Perhaps this could be a part of the plan and it&#39;s certainly something they would remember \ud83e\udd14</p>\n\n<p>Just hypothetically let&#39;s go with Icahn swooping in for a purchase of the notes for 6th street... Which potentially leads to a lot of profit for him here. We of course could speculate that Cohen could also potentially be in the market - Canadians too are allowed to purchase and very soon we shall start to see the &quot;new generation&quot; appearing in the bigger activist plays. It could also potentially explain Icahns plan with some of his withdrawn money.</p>\n\n<p>Quite possibly the reason we haven&#39;t heard either Icahn or Cohen mentioned in bbby is because of the legalities concerning the transactions, legal proceedings and the NOLS redemptions ... It&#39;s a head fuck to even begin to understand whether anyone is even allowed to fart these days without prior approval from someone \ud83d\ude02</p>\n\n<p>So to summise on this - let&#39;s just say Icahn and potentially Cohen swoop in for their stake in Sixth Street. Sixth street agrees to acquire and retain BBBY as a going concern and decide to eventually extract baby from bbby. Some wonderful fuzzy feelings and bonhomie all round for the key players on the winning team and everyone gets what they wanted.</p>\n\n<p>Hypothetically the above theory would mean a financial meltdown of epic proportions and some serious squeeze potentials and profits for all of those involved and would certainly be something to &quot;be remembered&quot; by...</p>\n\n<p>But what do I know - purely just an ape \ud83d\ude02</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/maFaYU09kMWner_E4eJ3SbOhATjJpBKmGFxsJyBlmmQ.jpg\"/></div>"},

Some of the posts I&#39;ve seen and people&#39;s selflessness have been a real inspiration and have certainly made hodling a whole lot easier.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m off to spend my weekend waiting for Monday (as always), waiting for my shares to go to something special and thinking about what more I can do to help others when BBBY rises from the ashes and how many lives that will give me the power to change. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for letting me be a part of a community that I both love and respect \ud83e\udee1</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s about time the little guy (or gal in my case \ud83d\ude02) won and show them how it&#39;s done \ud83d\ude4c</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
