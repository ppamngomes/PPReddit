That segment sounded way more genuine to me than I\u2019m sure it did most people.  See, I actually took my retirement portfolio and put it in the equivalent of  government treasuries during the time I started taking a overly large exposure in BBBY (shares only).  I felt the risk of BBBY was huge but the reward was bigger.  If I lost it all, I could justify taking a loan from retirement to float myself in the event of major expenses until I was able to re-save; that\u2019s how big I thought this play could be.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not here to justify my position on the greater economy, cause I\u2019m not handing out financial advice and cause most of you wouldn\u2019t give two cents about my macroeconomic views (We\u2019re here to discuss BBBY).</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you were some wealthy \u2018dude\u2019 who went to an Ivy League school and was actually trying to invest in BBBY, how would you justify exposure to this play to your social group?  How many of us have told friends and family about this just to be dismissed gently or worse?</p>\n\n<p>But why hasn\u2019t he read the dang SEC filings?  He even said they were backward looking.  When I first took a small position, the company was at the dreaded January media-induced bankruptcy. From there, I started reading filings and increasing my position as the company kept finding more ways to get funding.  Even funding via dilutive effect would allow the debt to start being reduced meaning bankruptcy was unlikely.  The consignment agreement was the biggest tell for me as that is effectively free life support.  And there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch.</p>\n\n<p>Yea, he is likely a financial reporter, and claims to usually only invest in safe crap.  But what if he was actually being genuine?  Have early long investors for once caught the wave before the \u2018smart\u2019 money?  Just my two cents.</p>\n\n<p>And don\u2019t mind the fact I\u2019m writing this at 3am, being in this play is one of the most risky things I\u2019ve done.  It\u2019s not exactly doing wonders for my health, but I still believe the reward will make up for it (whether it\u2019s an invaluable lesson on investing in garbage or a pool of gold coins I can swim in).</p>\n\n<p>P.S.  Thanks PP for bringing the contrarian views on. It\u2019s just annoying that there are so many trolls to sift through to get to logical bears (or non-bulls).</p>\n\n<p>Edit: changed autocorrect from \u2018not\u2019 to \u2018most\u2019 in 2nd sentence.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Ichan wanted something from RC.  You\u2019d invite someone over to your place if you wanted something from them.  What expertise would RC have that Ichan wouldn\u2019t?</p>\n\n<p>Ichan didn\u2019t understand the loyalty of \u2018meme\u2019 investors.  He wanted to know if it was replicable.  That if Ichan wanted to take a big name retail company and turn it into a way to \u2018fix the markets\u2019, how could he build a similar psychological following among retail/household to hold even as the price crashes into the ground.</p>\n\n<p>In exchange, RC knows that a hypothetical plan would involve a steep dive in stock price.  If he ever saw such a move in the market, it might be possible to think, \u201cI wonder if that\u2019s my buddy Icahn\u2019s play?.  Maybe I\u2019ll get in on that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Didn\u2019t we just see this recent offering with restrictive language against past and future shorts.  It\u2019s almost perfect opportunity for someone big to get invested who might realize what\u2019s going on.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
