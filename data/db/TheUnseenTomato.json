Thank you for the hard work vs I knew they were grifting all along. People getting mad because expectations weren&#39;t met and lashing out at others. People complaining bout &quot;where muh Dee Dee like the good old days&quot; while others just get incredibly hype from speculation and daydreams without any microscopic amount of real evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Does any of this matter? <strong>No.</strong> All your supposed legal expertise and &quot;cold hard facts&quot; if you&#39;re bearish or extensive black tar tinfoil and hopium snorting if you&#39;re bullish right now does not matter. </p>\n\n<p>In just a few days we&#39;ll know if the story continues or if it ends in a flash, regardless of how you may feel about the whole situation and everyone involved. There&#39;s not much anyone can do at this point so just <strong>relax</strong> and control your own emotions. No need to turn this sub into a soap opera on the final stretch.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
