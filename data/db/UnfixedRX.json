It got me thinking about some of my other accounts. </p>\n\n<p>I have a TradeStation account of which I use for trading futures. At some point I moved some money over to an equities trading account and bought some BBBYQ just to spread some positions around. When I looked at my October statement for TradeStation, I did not see a similar message as I saw on Fidelity. I noticed the account listed as a margin account though. I never traded on margin in my life so this caught me off guard. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR; I bought my shares with cash, but in a margin account. Am I worrying for nothing or should I expect shares+equity in this account as I would in my Fidelity account?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks, </p>\n\n<p>\u270c\ud83c\udffb</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff4500"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
