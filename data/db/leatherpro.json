Notice how tempered their relaunch has been. Why are they being so quiet?</p>\n\n<p>At this point it just makes logical business sense. Cause a historical stock market event that will have the entire world looking at your brand\u2026\u2026.and you\u2019re going to want to be open for business. \nI firmly believe Moass is early next week as they timed this event for Black Friday and Christmas sales. \nI\u2019ll hold as long as it takes but from a business viewpoint next week is the opportunity of a lifetime.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
