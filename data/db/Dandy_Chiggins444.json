Some worked towards beating the game, while others tried to sabotage it at any opportunity. Whenever I think of something to compare our journey to, I remember how a massive community came together and beat this game in just 17 days by entering a single input (each individually) at a time.  </p>\n\n<p>By no means was this an easy objective, however, through all the community&#39;s hardships, they overcame and succeeded in undertaking the next task together. They made decisions together and fought against each other all while working towards a common goal. In the end, they beat the game! all while leaving a legacy of their journey behind.  </p>\n\n<p>From that point, I knew and I remind myself about that story. I look back and think <strong>The internet is such a powerful place and when a community of like-minded individuals work together to succeed in a common goal, it&#39;s not impracticable to believe it will be achieved.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>I believe we are in the right place at the right time and although some of us might find it difficult to go day to day following the drips of information we receive, and facing conflicting information at times which leads to questioning ourselves. Our reward will greatly outweigh the hardships faced during our journey.  </p>\n\n<p>This is our internet phenomenon, Thank you to PP and crew for the contributions you&#39;ve made to this community by dedicating so much and sharing your <strong>opinions (NFA)</strong> around something we are all interested in.   </p>\n\n<p>Of course, <strong>none of what I say should be taken as finance advice</strong>, I&#39;m just a smooth brain who compared a videogame to a potential M&amp;A.  </p>\n\n<p>For those interested here&#39;s a summary video of the first Twitch Plays Pokemon event: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hEKbfId5oHM?si=7LJmeDg8w-0wTlY2\">https://youtu.be/hEKbfId5oHM?si=7LJmeDg8w-0wTlY2</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "TRUST ME BRO", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ea0027"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
