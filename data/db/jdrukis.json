This is because CS doesn\u2019t have any information to contest his request to be closed. That is different than confirmation that there won\u2019t be any further action but I was Phil I would have expressed urgency knowing that it would be harder for them to reverse their decision if new information came out.  </p>\n\n<p>CS accepted Phil\u2019s bags because CS hasn\u2019t seen anything like this before. Will they do it again? No, not likely. I expect since we haven\u2019t seen any other shorts prove the same that this was a one-off. Our squeeze doesn\u2019t occur with the very few retail shorts, it is with the multiples of the float short held on an institutional level. </p>\n\n<p>So Phil, if you are reading this\u2026 you may want to touch base with CS to confirm they will dissolve you of all future action on that position because I\u2019m willing to bet they won\u2019t because they can\u2019t confirm there isn\u2019t going to be. </p>\n\n<p>Phil, CS just fuk\u2019d you big time. You no longer can close as one of the first in double digit prices\u2026 you have to wait for CS to reinstate your short position before you can close it. I\u2019m willing to bet CS will attempt to close their own before they give you the chance to close yours. </p>\n\n<p>But hey, there is a bright side here Phil\u2026 at least you won\u2019t be messing around with short positions anymore.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
