I am a long-time member of the GameStonk saga. Here in Bobby, there are a handful that have done stellar, amazing DD. We all know who you are, and I want to commend you. Without your deep-dive efforts to provide clarity and research as to the possible happenings with Bobby and Baby, we would not be here today. Your work has influenced tens of thousands, and world events and that have yet to occur. It&#39;s quite incredible when you take a step back.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I wanted to remind this sub about is how important DRS is. The more shares that are DRS&#39;d, the bigger the squeeze. Removing shares from the float creates more volatility and upward pressure on the stock. If shares are not DRS&#39;d, SHFs and market makers are free to continue naked shorting, and have a <em>much</em> easier time manipulating the share price in their favor, regardless of buy pressure.</p>\n\n<p>There can, and will, be catalysts that put shorts in a corner and force them to close. Their continued attacks here (shills), on Icahn (IEP and Hindenburg), and smear campaigns against Pulte are continued evidence that we are on the right path and that shorts are under threat.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t understate how important DRS is. Without it, we are on our heels, no matter how many apes worldwide are buying this stock in a frenzy.</p>\n\n<p>My AST account is currently in the mail. When I log in, I&#39;m going to check if there is any Plan vs. Book bs, similar to Computershare. I will update here.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, NO DINGLEBERRIES. Pure DRS is the only way. Look up &quot;Heat Lamp Theory&quot; on google, it&#39;s in another minor GameStonk sub that has this DD. TBD if this is an issue with AST.</p>\n\n<p>DRS also ensures that if you are keeping your shares for the Baby acquisition into the new entity (351 code per the latest RC tweet), there will be no issue, because you do not have synthetics. Remember, your broker owns your (potentially synthetic) shares. If the latest Speculation DD is correct that the new Bobby issued shares via HBC and others were bought up by major players, they own &gt;80% of outstanding shares, leaving roughly 100 million to apes. Given how cheap the stock is, if this is the case, I am CONFIDENT that apes here already own more than the float. DRS is the only way to lock it, otherwise we own synthetics and MMs and SHFs are business as usual.</p>\n\n<p>I have no idea if this will be an issue, but if it is found that more than the float is owned, brokers because they own the shares (not you), can simply delete them from your account. I believe this happened with Dole in the past. (Wrinkles please confirm). I have NO IDEA if this will be an issue. It&#39;s your call what you do. Not trying to spread fear or fud. Something to ponder as you make your game plan.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck everyone!</p>\n\n<p>Food stamps or Ferraris.</p>\n\n<p>Or shares in the new entity.</p>\n\n<p>Not financial advice.</p>\n\n<p>Our suspicions will soon be revealed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
