If they don\u2019t close it, then their gain is considered unrealised,  and they aren\u2019t liable to pay any taxes on it. This is why  bankruptcy is a short sellers wet dream. They get to utilise all that capital without creating a taxable event. </p>\n\n<p>Now why was Phil The Short so eager to get a courtesy close on BBBY? Is he afraid of this stock resurrecting and wrecking him? Either way, he may be off the hook, but his broker has more than likely assumed the liability.
