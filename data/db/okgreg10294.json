SUDDENLY phill post that he has his position closed. Fucking hilarious timing. It&#39;s not like people have beed asking him for evidence since he claimed that they gave him a courtesy close. Im impressed that either a) they think that everyone is stupid enough not to notice the timing or b) brokers are so desperate to get rid of a liability that they would put themselves at high risk and take the short positions themselves. </p>\n\n<p>We are close.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
