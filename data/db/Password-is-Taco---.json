Been lurking in this sub for a little while and got hooked by the community\u2019s vibe. I am just looking for some general advice, I tried google and it made me feel more regarded. I am mid 30s with a mortgage and 3 kids. 2 boys and a girl all under the age of 5. They are my world. To pay the bills I work @45k job, that I somewhat enjoy, which has been really valuable to me. As I could make more $ and have, but doing something not soul crushing carries a lot of weight. Irrrregardlesss I\u2019ve always been young dumb and on my own. Now I want to give my family everything.  When we go to the moon, is there a way I can use my shares as a form of collateral or insurance, I believe in the company and don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever want to sell my shares, but I want the $, don\u2019t know how to get it without selling. \nSorry  for the long text, was enjoying a thinking like in the basement. Thanks for any help\nSee you in space</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
