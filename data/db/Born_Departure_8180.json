BUYBUY BABY Banner Spin-off &amp; Spin-off BABY Shares:</strong> &quot;... unlock value trapped withing the Company&#39;s underperforming shares is a sale or spin-off of the Baby Banner.&quot; As we have already seen a partial sale of BABY IP to Dream on Me, this still falls under RC&#39;s recommendation to the board.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tu9b2hqkfsdb1.png?width=1162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0751f0ed55448390d8adffb127f5dffbdac8d252\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/tu9b2hqkfsdb1.png?width=1162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0751f0ed55448390d8adffb127f5dffbdac8d252\"></a></p>\n\n<p>- &quot;We believe it is likely much more valuable than the Company&#39;s entire market capitalization today.&quot; at the time of this letter, BBBY shares were around $15/share.</p>\n\n<p>- At the event of a BABY spin-off, BBBYQ will rise to the valuation of BABY spin-off valuation per share, leading to Call contracts $0.50 - $15 (minimum) to be ITM causing Gamma Squeeze we saw 2 years ago in GME Jan 2021. RC stated at $15/share is highly undervalued.</p>\n\n<p>- We even saw the board announce a reverse stock split but rescinded shortly after.</p>\n\n<p>- Confirming this point <a href=\"/u/okbet9545\">u/okbet9545</a> tweeted about the docket today that &quot;New Shares can be issued if BBBYQs are canceled there&#39;s a provision somewhere in the new dockets stating this.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/klxnhlhkgsdb1.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e14303d1dbb75304d8e100814ef0c5aa220a12fb\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/klxnhlhkgsdb1.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e14303d1dbb75304d8e100814ef0c5aa220a12fb\"></a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\n\n<p>I believe EVEN IF, RC is not part of BBBY sale (which I highly doubt this be the case), BBBYQ WILL STILL SQUEEZE to ATH and beyond (Gamma squeeze &amp; Shorts closing). I think we will do what GME couldn&#39;t since buy buttons were shut off in Jan 2021. RC already set the plan in motion back in March 2022 leading him to sell in Aug 2022.
