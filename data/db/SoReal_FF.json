I believe it is happening November 3rd. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know if, once the transfer is complete, I&#39;ll still have the records of the various amount of BBBYQ I had for when we MOASS? Or would the profile completely wipe those records and it&#39;ll be like I never had it at all? Couldn&#39;t really find an answer online so if anyone can help this smooth ape it&#39;d be greatly appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>Love y&#39;all, and thanks in advance!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
