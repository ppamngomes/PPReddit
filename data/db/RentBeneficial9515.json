Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful if like me? I want to go buy something for my grandson some clothes. If I could review or I could chat with other buyers of that 1 product on screen like a live chat or I could just check out the reviews or what if I could actually send a link to like my sister and have her view what I&#39;m looking at at that time like a zoom meeting almost but. We&#39;re shopping together from across the company country. Wouldn&#39;t that be wicked cool?\nAnd it would also be cool if you could have a favorite bucket or if you could have a couple different buckets within your bucket, so like you could do your Christmas shopping, but then you have to buy something individually. You don&#39;t lose everything in your bucket. Just because you wanna purchase one item out of the 10 or something like that? Because I&#39;m tired of shopping and losing everything in my bucket. When I have a wish list going and then all of a sudden. I have to put it all back. Cause I just need to purchase 1 or 2 items, you know?\nNow that gives a whole new insight to modern day shopping.</p>\n\n<p>This was a message I sent to my son on my way to work so sorry if it&#39;s not formatted properly. I&#39;ve been a lurker for 3 yrs lol but don&#39;t have enough karma to post. So ty for letting me post here!!!\ud83d\udc9c</p>\n\n<p>Edit: OMG Grannies on the PPSHOW!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
