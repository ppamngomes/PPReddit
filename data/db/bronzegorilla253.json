I also think I saw that the agent had changed. Did BBBYQ&#39;s agent change? If so who is it now. Also if it didn&#39;t change, is the website up, operational, and open? Lastly, will the selling process be similar to Computer$hare&#39;s for \ud83c\udfae and \ud83c\udf7f?</p>\n\n<p>Sorry, I&#39;m a simple ape to busy with scraping by to focus on teddies.
