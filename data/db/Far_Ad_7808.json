Whalewisdom shows that most players dumped their puts on 8/14 or prior. I believe a mass exodus of a position would cause price volatility, especially if the PUTS were exercised. The contract obligation if exercised would require the shares be bought back at the strike price by the issuing broker if I\u2019m not mistaken. Those strike prices can be all over the place depending on when the position was opened. I do not work in finance so this all may be a nothing. Hoping someone with a larger scope can help fill in the blanks if I\u2019ve gotten anything wrong. I\u2019ve noticed the PP SHOW has become very exceptional at helping us regular investors grow together with deciphering facts from fiction.
