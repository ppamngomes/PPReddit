During the last years we got ample evidence that this is how the stock market operates (see last DD <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17bqu2g/blurring_massive_naked_short_positions_need_to_be/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17bqu2g/blurring_massive_naked_short_positions_need_to_be/</a>). Looking at the loopring whitepaper (<a href=\"https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf\">https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf</a>) and imagine a stock exchange based on self-custodial wallets and decentralized exchanges there eventually cannot be counterfeit assets, given certain conditions (see below). In this environment Fails to Deliver, Settlement Fails, Wrong labeling, False Locates, Naked Options and Perpetual Rolling may not occur. For context this is all about the loopring technology based on Etherium and not about their token (LRC).</p>\n\n<p>As main condition everyone would have to use the particular uncompromised platform. E.g. the loopring wallet app for iPhone or Android, again not talking about LRC as a token here. If on the opposite every broker kept its own platform and would pinky promise to connect to the Loopring backend, we could probably end up in the same situation as today. Brokers could internalize orders or route to only certain exchanges. So how to solve this? A) only allow &quot;Loopring App&quot; for holding and trading shares B) implement authenticity checks at B1) shareholder interactions, like voting B2) other purposes, like interacting with products of the company (e.g. the Twitter Account would connect with your wallet and show the amount of shares you own).</p>\n\n<p>So this as an example for the &quot;ownership&quot; part (see also the DD about ownership here <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17bqueo/blurring_massive_naked_short_positions_need_to_be/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17bqueo/blurring_massive_naked_short_positions_need_to_be/</a>), for the exchange part solution A would solve the issue, B maybe. A graphical overview of those stages:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xydj58ujjc0c1.png?width=1653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2b846aff6d2c2eadc52db3903b8d9332a38fd76\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/xydj58ujjc0c1.png?width=1653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2b846aff6d2c2eadc52db3903b8d9332a38fd76\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/xydj58ujjc0c1.png?width=1653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2b846aff6d2c2eadc52db3903b8d9332a38fd76\"></a></p>\n\n<p>We will go on in this post mostly assuming the green path would take the majority of shares and orders (aka \u201cfree and fair market\u201d).</p>\n\n<h1>How would shorting work in such a market?</h1>\n\n<p>Here is a thought experiment on how shorting could work in such a free and fair market.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say realGME was the token of the company and wrappedGME the derivative which you get instead of realGME when lending your share.</p>\n\n<p>1) If you buy a tokenized stock you would always know that realGME is the one which is a real share, always with 1:1 voting rights and 1:1 rights of 1/(shares outstanding) of the company, always.</p>\n\n<p>2) A buyer would therefore only buy realGME, not some wrappedGME (this is very different today with e.g. EU brokers going to EU exchanges and only offering GS2C instead of GME).</p>\n\n<p>3) A shortseller would then need to somehow get realGME which he needs to sell to a buyer, he could not sell wrappedGME. Yes, you could maybe fuck around with the derivative wrappedGME, but you could not with realGME - thus any buyer always gets a real share, the lender may be cheated, true. So the lender should know the risk when getting wrappedGME. Today lenders and buyers are cheated. Also the (short-term) negative price pressure on realGME would still be there. Keep this in mind for now.</p>\n\n<p>4) The new buyer becomes owner of the realGME with its voting and economic rights on the company attached, no one can take the realGME from him by whichever force.</p>\n\n<p>5) The old owner who gave his share away to shortsellers receiving a wrappedGME which only signals the ownership rights on a realGME, but losing his voting and economic rights - the old owner got a derivative, which is clear at the time.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So the ownership right is clear in every second of this transaction. This is fundamentally different than today.</p>\n\n<p>And now to make this system work we would need:</p>\n\n<p>6) wrappedGME could be provided by a smart contract which holds collateral from the short seller (e.g. ETH or some kind of USD).</p>\n\n<p>7) the short seller can either buy back a realGME and exchange it for wrappedGME or in case of a &quot;margin call&quot; the smart contract will automatically buy back realGME and do the exchange.</p>\n\n<p>7b) for this to work the margin call would always be below the value of the collateral.</p>\n\n<p>7c) still, in extreme situations when the price of realGME is higher than the value of the collateral a buy back is not possible. Then the old owner would lose the realGME and receive the collateral instead.</p>\n\n<p>7d) we&#39;d likely see a huge number of variants in how collateral is paid, upon which terms, etc.</p>\n\n<p>In short: shorts would still pretty much work, maybe even better than today. But it forces more honesty between two people or entities making a deal.</p>\n\n<h1>Comparing todays short technics with those in a free and fair market</h1>\n\n<p>However, there are many more tactics to influence a stock price and we will dive into each and look whether the whitepaper provides a solution.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ftdbm4iwjc0c1.png?width=2253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d35f0343f9385670ec374813f255ed03d5ea8253\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/ftdbm4iwjc0c1.png?width=2253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d35f0343f9385670ec374813f255ed03d5ea8253\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/ftdbm4iwjc0c1.png?width=2253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d35f0343f9385670ec374813f255ed03d5ea8253\"></a></p>\n\n<h1>What is left for shorts and how can we be one or two steps ahead?</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uddjl5gzjc0c1.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e42387abbdbea5e264e41009ea034ac84d7e0f88\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/uddjl5gzjc0c1.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e42387abbdbea5e264e41009ea034ac84d7e0f88\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/uddjl5gzjc0c1.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e42387abbdbea5e264e41009ea034ac84d7e0f88\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Man, such a free and fair market would be something I am really scared of if I had a lot of naked shorts in nearly every stock on the planet. This would indeed something, shorts never forget.</p>\n\n<p>Since its also a few years that individual investors theorized such a system for GME, there is no way shorts haven\u2019t been doing this for some years now. And while there might be countermeasures from shorts in the political, regulatory, behavioral and so many different corners, we will just look at their usual techniques and see what\u2019s left. So the three main things which work independently of a fee and fair market are pumps &amp; dumps, poops &amp; scoops, short &amp; distort. Let\u2019s call them traps.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c9ofal32kc0c1.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=856d417de0e1fe188351c765ab7c18a490b6b1cc\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/c9ofal32kc0c1.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=856d417de0e1fe188351c765ab7c18a490b6b1cc\" alt=\"  https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17pszls/comment/k87n3xy/\"></a></p>\n\n<p>So if they cannot beat individual investors by their normal tactics they have to probably level up on what\u2019s left. Ah, and make no mistake also institutional investors are being played. Don\u2019t forget, this is a game of longs vs naked shorts.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to be one step ahead, we should discuss exactly the matter of this post. We know about GME pretty well, but we can only direct register every share once, so probably the question in which stock to invest is a pretty important questions. Maybe also some might want to become activist investors themselves. Therefore, to be two steps ahead we should already begin to understand short traps (where a subset is surely \u201cmeme traps\u201d). And I imagine this is game where we never finish learning. Let\u2019s begin.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/v20yqz/best_tldr_of_this_whole_saga_by_ujgatprime/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/v20yqz/best_tldr_of_this_whole_saga_by_ujgatprime/</a> (I really recommend you to look through the comments of JG-at-Prime)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210131131256/http:/www.counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock20Full.pdf\">https://web.archive.org/web/20210131131256/http://www.counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock20Full.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf\">https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf0c Gone Full Beyond! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf0c", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/V_ecWYCIdT1pK69px_DWsbX6ezyBbEORyOlZSWO6-k0.jpg\"/></div>"},

Interestingly I also found that Credit Suisse per Regal Funds Management bought 61m shares late 2020 (<a href=\"https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/FUN/02316076.pdf\">https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/FUN/02316076.pdf</a>) and sold them in 2021 (<a href=\"https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/TOY/02407424.pdf\">https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/TOY/02407424.pdf</a>). </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>3. Voted shares in October 2023 were roughly 502m - so minus the 412m we got a float of just 90m? Also with 550m shares being traded this year?</h1>\n\n<p>Proxyvotes as of June 2021: 512,329,033 (<a href=\"https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/FUN/02387251.pdf\">https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/FUN/02387251.pdf</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Proxyvotes 2023 are roughly 502m (<a href=\"https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/TOY/02726850.pdf\">https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/TOY/02726850.pdf</a>)</p>\n\n<p>So taking those 502m shares minus 412m shares owned by the three entities above we get 90m shares for the open market. In October alone 300m shares were traded so far, 550m ytd. So roughly 6x the assumed float. But don&#39;t forget, those three entities could very well dump their shares on retail and crush the price further.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>4. Regarding the voting results the 3 parties didn&#39;t vote in alignment, so at least 1 party is disagreeing with the other 1-2.</h1>\n\n<p>Whatever exCEO Penny Cox did to <a href=\"/u/Badmojo6969\">u/Badmojo6969</a>, 257m votes didn&#39;t like her while 244m did. Also the ratification of prior issue of 59.8m shares was only voted for by 187m while 262m voted against (<a href=\"https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/TOY/02726850.pdf\">https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/TOY/02726850.pdf</a>).</p>\n\n<p>While we don&#39;t actually know who voted what we can assume that <strong>Louis Mittoni with his 261m votes voted against the 59.8m share placement</strong>. While probably everybody else voted for. He probably voted also against Cox (while ... why didn&#39;t he vote all shares there?). Also interesting</p>\n\n<p>Warning: I am no expert with voting esp. for any differences which might be applicable in Australia and maybe I got this completely wrong. </p>\n\n<p>However, we can probably safely assume that the three parties don&#39;t align here as they would have together a voting power of 412m.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Coming back to some questions from Part 1:</p>\n\n<p>This is Penny Cox (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pennycoxmba/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/pennycoxmba/</a>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Oct 2021 till today Co-Founder at Rockpool Rum</li>\n<li>Apr 2020 to Dec 2020 SVP for Growth and Head of Recommerce (SVP)</li>\n<li>Jan 2019 to March 2020 SVP Lazada Group / Regional Supermarket</li>\n<li>Feb 2014 to Feb 2019 RedMart: VP Commercial, VP of On Demand Delivery</li>\n<li>MBA INSEAD 2012-2013, 2002-2006 MEng University of Cambridge, 2004-2005 GPA Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1 year exchange programme)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Why was the 2x dilution replaced with a 58m private offering?

Is a successful turnaround enough? Did for example naked shorts bleed with the Tesla meteoric rise in share price or did they just switch sides and end up earning even more money? Is pure DRS enough? How is the system working today anyway and what needs to change?</p>\n\n<p>To answer those questions we will dive in:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What is a share and where is it held?</li>\n<li>How many entities technically have access to a share?</li>\n<li>Where are the shares traded and how is the price derived?</li>\n<li>How regular people think price discovery works and how it actually works?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>1. What is a share and where is it held?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A share of a company consists of voting and economic rights. Vote on the annual meeting and thus have direct influence of who runs the company and indirect to the strategy and organization</p>\n\n<p>Economic right is the right to own and you would think also to buy and sell. But the right to buy and sell is not attached to a share but rather in combination with an exchange and a broker-dealer, e.g. the right to buy was removed per brokers during January 21 and in general with places like \u201cthe expert market\u201d, where only a few brokers allow individual investors to buy, while one can sell anytime. Also some brokers (maybe the minority) allow one to select an exchange or OTC to place your order while some don\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p>Like with money you can decide where to hold your shares. Money can be held as hard cash in your wallet, in a bank account or even be invested and held in a derivative (e.g. overnight money). Thus, when giving the money to another party it becomes clear that they are technically able to do something with it, e.g. loan or invest it. This could technically be done without your consent, which might be legally required or not. So the next question is when changing the way to hold an asset (money or shares) how many entities have technically access to it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How many entities technically have access to a share?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The place the share is held also defines how many entities technically have access to the share. Legally that\u2019s a different story, but see with a broker-dealer you are holding an entitlement as beneficial owner. For Transfer Agent Regulations the SEC called for comments on transfer agent regulation in 2015, since current regulations are from 1977 (<a href=\"https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2015-32755.pdf\">https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2015-32755.pdf</a>, p. 1) . Obviously, no regulation was put into action and there is rather no action and meetings since 2019. Looking at what the SEC already state in 2015 is that shares maybe not safe with a transfer agent and issuer plan are typically not in the name of the investor (p. 194 and <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investor-publications/holding-your-securities-get-the-facts\">https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investor-publications/holding-your-securities-get-the-facts</a>). <a href=\"/u/Bibic-jr\">u/Bibic-jr</a> created this wonderful graph in showing the differences in the ways of holding shares:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/th9wc4hx07vb1.png?width=309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef595f2bfd309cc554a9f0cc37e638e3a2338c58\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/th9wc4hx07vb1.png?width=309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef595f2bfd309cc554a9f0cc37e638e3a2338c58\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/th9wc4hx07vb1.png?width=309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef595f2bfd309cc554a9f0cc37e638e3a2338c58\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Yet, it bugged me that all of those ways include at least one counterparty who technically has access. So I added one more step and compared the amount of entities having technical access with Money, Crypto and Shares:</p>\n\n<p>Who should have access to your equity? Here&#39;s how to hold for your preference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8akkja4017vb1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2bfab2aa8d5d232589537554c689c903e3ee6cf\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/8akkja4017vb1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2bfab2aa8d5d232589537554c689c903e3ee6cf\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/8akkja4017vb1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2bfab2aa8d5d232589537554c689c903e3ee6cf\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Wait a minute\u2026 so DRS is not the way? Indeed, it\u2019s the only way. DRS and DWAC transfers into Direct Registration might be the only way out of this fraudulent system.. Still, one entity beside you always has access and could in theory also remove the buy button. Can MOASS happen with another entity having access? I don\u2019t know and I repeat, without DRS we are stuck in the system with DTC.</p>\n\n<p>Some may also ask, wait but Plan is equal to Pure DRS isn&#39;t it? Well the SEC said &quot;[t]o hold in DRS once [plan shares] are acquired, you would need to instruct the transfer agent to move the securities from the issuer plan to DRS&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investor-publications/holding-your-securities-get-the-facts\">https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investor-publications/holding-your-securities-get-the-facts</a>), since share plans (dividend reinvestment, direct stock purchase, etc.) could not be considered your property (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-27-15/s72715-40.pdf\">https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-27-15/s72715-40.pdf</a>, p.12). Also finra says that \u201c[y]ou\u2019ll need to instruct the transfer agent to move [bought plan shares] to the DRS\u201d <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/know-the-facts-direct-registered-shares\">https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/know-the-facts-direct-registered-shares</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Next, to exercise the economic right to buy or sell there must be an economic value, which is detached from the share and the place it is stored.</p>\n\n<p>Part 3: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17bqu2g/blurring_massive_naked_short_positions_need_to_be/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17bqu2g/blurring_massive_naked_short_positions_need_to_be/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf0c Gone Full Beyond! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf0c", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wZ2kgOGRY79qdHcb7lgFtDFccW7fKTnqU-RFr62xYVU.jpg\"/></div>"},

Where are the shares traded and how is the price derived?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Economic value is defined by the exchange (or OTC) where the share is traded. The market capitalization of a company is defined by the public exchange where the security is mainly listed, e.g. NYSE or NASDAQ.</p>\n\n<p>For some security this exchange will have not the most volume, which is kind of odd isn\u2019t it? Also the security might trade on foreign exchanges or in dark pools, the latter often deriving the price from public exchanges (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp</a>), while having far greater value than the public exchange.</p>\n\n<p>Those exchanges use an order book to match bids for supply and demand. Watching the the Wallstreet Conspiracy (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26_IcexvePA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26_IcexvePA</a>) or The Problem (<a href=\"https://www.theproblem.com/episode-5-the-problem-with-the-stock-market/\">https://www.theproblem.com/episode-5-the-problem-with-the-stock-market/</a>) it\u2019s always about scraping pennies on the dollar. So doesn\u2019t really feel that bad, does it?</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s recap how regular people think price discovery is working and see how price discovery it\u2019s actually working with all we learned during the journey.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4a. How regular people think price discovery works?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Supply &amp; Demand sets the Price. You can think of this as an orderbook, so for a price of $25 there are buy orders for 50 shares, while for a price of roughly $11 there are buy orders for 150 shares.<br/>\n At the same time for $25 there are sell orders for 150 shares and at ~$0 only 50 shares are paper handed. The intersection of those curves is than what defines the market price which is roughly $15 with a volume of roughly 100 shares exchanged hands.</p>\n\n<p>Sounds easy right? And would look like this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nisa4oymz6vb1.png?width=947&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8abd56123d40675f5e555b8584f90e9a9847ae1c\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/nisa4oymz6vb1.png?width=947&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8abd56123d40675f5e555b8584f90e9a9847ae1c\" alt=\"Price is where Supply and Demand meet, \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc37(\ud835\udc43)=\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc43) where Q is quantity of D(emand) and S(upply) at a certain (P)rice (see: https://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/v1/book/text/leibniz-08-04-02.html)\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to a young boy from Bulgaria (Vlad Tenev, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/RfEuNHVPc_k?t=1305\">https://www.youtube.com/live/RfEuNHVPc_k?t=1305</a>) GME investors soon learned about Payment for Order Flow, which would route orders to wherever the counterparty, mainly Citadel and Virtu in our case, wants. The Problem with Jon Steward (<a href=\"https://www.theproblem.com/episode-5-the-problem-with-the-stock-market/what-is-the-stock-market\">https://www.theproblem.com/episode-5-the-problem-with-the-stock-market/what-is-the-stock-market</a>) and also the movie Gaming Wallstreet (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18332840/\">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18332840/</a>) brought the concept on the big screen.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7awurp0tz6vb1.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0a025c1a447c65f56deb09a5748915a5afd040b\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/7awurp0tz6vb1.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0a025c1a447c65f56deb09a5748915a5afd040b\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/7awurp0tz6vb1.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0a025c1a447c65f56deb09a5748915a5afd040b\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The Problem states that this scheme is to make pennies off of every transaction processed. However, Dark Pools were literally defined to do large trades without price adverse effects on the price [<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp%5C\">https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp\\</a>]. Some of them use the past price of lit exchanges (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp</a>), where individual investors trades barely go to. Rereading some old DD it feels like there are some logical flaws in the early DDs. Like this post claiming &quot;I don&#39;t believe you can suppress the price of a stock through manipulation that only involves dark pools or off-exchange trading, as it is all publicly reported.&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o70lid/dark_pools_price_discovery_and_short/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o70lid/dark_pools_price_discovery_and_short/</a>). But I rather agree with the logical deduction in the comment (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o70lid/comment/h2w36ex/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o70lid/comment/h2w36ex/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Price is a function of supply and demand (like shown above). If you now print several different graphs instead of one and spread demand over them the individual demand is lower, while as a big market maker supply is not a problem even without naked shorts. So naturally the price will be lower when having several exchanges with lower demand but high supply (sponsored by the liquidity fairy). As example, let\u2019s take lemonade stalls. Supply of lemonade is ample. So imagine, there is just one stall and everyday there is a huuuge queue (high demand) in comparison to you having one stall but there are like 10 more lemonade stalls around you and the queue would spread equally. In which scenario would it be easier to raise the price of lemonade? Easy, isn&#39;t it?</p>\n\n<p>Further there are settlement delays (T+2 at least) and shorting which allow broker-dealer and market makers to temporarily inflate supply and thus lower the price.

So what are the steps to do so?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE FOR A FAIR MARKET</strong></p>\n\n<p>A massive short squeeze may not happen with GME under current market structure. Too many entities have access to shares in a way that the supply/demand relationship can always be manipulated through a nearly endless number of tactics including corrupt exchanges to suppress true price discovery. The main way an individual investor can change the current situation is by limiting access to their shares to exclusively themselves and that\u2019s through the DRS system.</p>\n\n<p>The second part beside exclusive ownership is something we cannot do ourselves easily. It\u2019s an uncorrupt exchanges like tzero or loopring doing the absolute majority of the trades.</p>\n\n<p>Only with those two pieces in place a large short squeeze may begin to unfold. The foundation of that happening is due to large short positions that exist as a hidden asset. The asset exists, but it\u2019s hidden and therefore isn\u2019t reflected in current market price. It is only through the extraction of this hidden asset that it will contribute to fair market price for the stock.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf0c Gone Full Beyond! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf0c", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PtclAji0QYgf8h-_qKyEbxpC3JLJhLk0xZVdKILV2go.jpg\"/></div>"},
