Observed on the 10th day of the lunar month of Tishri, this year Yom Kippur begins at sundown on Sunday Sept. 24th and finishes at sunset on Monday Sept 25.</p>\n\n<p>Some sins, such as not keeping the Sabbath, God will forgive. But God will not forgive wrongdoing against another human, unless you make peace with that person, and ask them for forgiveness (Do you hear that, Stevie Cohen?). Leading up to and on the day of Yom Kippur, Jews traditionally ask for forgiveness for their wrongdoings from God, and from their fellow human beings.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this is a message to us. Maybe we need to cleanse and prepare ourselves. Maybe we can expect the amended plan at any moment after the Sabbath has passed. Or maybe it means we can expect something just before, or just after, Yom Kippur.  </p>\n\n<p>Or, maybe this is a message to the shills, shorts and financial terrorists. Maybe those sons of bitches have a limited time to atone for their sins, because the wrath of God is a motherfucker. </p>\n\n<p>The shorts are going bye-bye, and the consequences will be biblical.  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Spiritual enlightenment is a tough game.
