While a buyer could potentially be an interested party in a bankruptcy filing, the term &quot;interested party&quot; generally refers to any person or entity that has a legal or financial interest in the bankruptcy case, such as creditors, shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p>A buyer may become an interested party if they are attempting to purchase assets from the debtor or acquire ownership in the company through the bankruptcy proceedings. In this case, the buyer&#39;s interests would be tied to the outcome of the bankruptcy case, and they would have a stake in how the debtor&#39;s assets are distributed.</p>\n\n<p>However, it&#39;s important to note that the status of an interested party is determined by the court and is based on the specific facts and circumstances of each case. Whether a buyer qualifies as an interested party in a particular bankruptcy case would depend on the nature of their interest and the specific rules and procedures governing the case.</p>\n\n<p>Non chat gpt thoughts:</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve googled the term and found info on the site linked below and it seems to kinda back it up. Interested party just seems to mean anyone with a financial or legal interest that has the right to be heard by the court. However, note that the uscourts glossary uses the term \u201cparty in interest\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>According to chatgpt again: party in interest means someone with a direct stake while interested party can represent those with a direct and indirect exposure to the outcome. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.canb.uscourts.gov/glossary/party-interest#:%7E:text=A%20party%20who%20has%20standing,in%20interest%20for%20most%20matters\">https://www.canb.uscourts.gov/glossary/party-interest#:~:text=A%20party%20who%20has%20standing,in%20interest%20for%20most%20matters</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone can provide a clear definition with source that would be dope</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
