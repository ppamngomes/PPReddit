I&#39;m inclined to think this is connected to German Apes doing the mass-exodus from German brokers towards IBKR. Depository for German BBY shares is Clearstream. Depository for BBBYQ shares is the DTCC in the US. Might be the reason for the delayed and cancelled transfers out of German Brokers we have seen lately. </p>\n\n<p>I eat crayons.

It seems there really is no logic behind which ones get approved and which do not. This is unacceptable. I am determined to get to the bottom of this and find out what needs to be done in order to have tradeable BBYQ shares in your IBKR account, eligible to DRS with AST / EQ. </p>\n\n<p><strong>If you initiated a transfer after trading of BBY got suspended in Germany please participate</strong>, I&#39;d be interested in the following information (without long stories attached to make it easier).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please share (in this order):</strong>  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When did you attempt the transfer?<br/></li>\n<li>Your German broker you are moving / have moved shares away from </li>\n<li>Your IBKR settings. Is Pink Sheet / OTC trading enabled already? What base currency are you using?</li>\n<li>What transfer instructions did you use at IBKR when requesting the transfer out of your German broker? Did you try to select BBY or BBBYQ from the IBKR dropdown?</li>\n<li>Did you send another signed transfer instruction letter to your broker or did you only use the advice generated via IBKR?</li>\n<li>Was the transfer succesful? </li>\n<li>If it was successful: What shares ended up in your IBKR account? BBY or BBBYQ? </li>\n<li>If you got BBY shares in IBKR: Did you manage to do a successful sector transfer and revert to BBYQ?</li>\n<li>If unsuccessful: What was the reason given by IBKR or your broker? </li>\n<li>Did you file a compliant with German Bafin already? If yes, did you hear back from them? Please share the answer.<br/></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It must be possible to map out a logic behind this, so that each individual investor is able to make an informed decision regarding their investment. I still have a small position of BBY still left at ING and will attempt to move them over today.
