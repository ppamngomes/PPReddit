Let&#39;s say for fun they are $25 each. That immediately puts the brokers out of money if everybody sold at once,  but we won&#39;t sell, so what keeps them from starting over with the shorting and regular ways they have to supress stocks?</p>\n\n<p>Can someone tell me how this makes anyone close or will stop the problems we have? I see this in a similar way that Jimmy&#39;s dividend went.  Dtcc doesn&#39;t have enough shares but between them and the brokers nothing happened.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
