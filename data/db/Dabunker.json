Keep in mind I am not even smart enough to eat crayons because I can&#39;t figure out how to open the box and no one will give unboxed crayons to me any longer due to my previous gastric complications with the blue ones. Must be something about the dye... </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the PPShow crew was talking about Pulte going on about $500 when in Florida and they were wondering if there was any relevance to share price in a cash offer situation, or something of the like. </p>\n\n<p>This seems too high of a share price to me, so wondered what the share price would be if they did a 7 for 1 reverse split and priced it at $500, and what would that be per share pre-reverse split. Divided 500 by 7. The total caught my eye and thought I would share. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s $71.42. Funny there&#39;s that those pesky 7 4 1 digits again. In fact, if you carry it out, it repeats a six digit number. </p>\n\n<p>Here it is taken out to 100 digits: </p>\n\n<p><strong>71.428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Probably nothing, and the $25 per share as floor kind of makes sense. $71.42 a share would be $8 billion or so on the low end if public float was only 110 million. However wanted to share as I found it interesting and had not seen anyone post this yet. </p>\n\n<p>Carry on... </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
