And it says when the exchange initiates a delist they do it by filing a Form 25, and the delist is effective 10 days after that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In addition, the rules of the exchange must, at a minimum, provide the following: (1) notice to the issuer of the exchange\u2019s decision to delist its securities; (2) an opportunity for appeal to the national securities exchange\u2019s board of directors, or to a committee designated by the board; and (3) public notice, no fewer than 10 days before the delisting becomes effective, of the exchange\u2019s final determination to delist the security <strong>via a press release and posting on the exchange\u2019s Web site.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This says no less than 10 days from when NASDAQ announced it on their website, but this doesn&#39;t govern over the above as they still haven&#39;t filed the Form 10.</p>\n\n<p>downloadable pdf link:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-52029.pdf\">https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-52029.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now to confuse the issue, this is from a Motley Fool article, but it&#39;s posted on the NASDAQ site:</p>\n\n<p><strong>If the company fails to comply</strong></p>\n\n<p>If the conditions that triggered the deficiency notice are not met in time, the NASDAQ will then send the company a delisting letter, which must be disclosed to the public within four business days.</p>\n\n<p>There is an appeal procedure that a company can use, if it feels that it doesn&#39;t deserve to be delisted or if it can regain compliance in a reasonable amount of time. Once the company receives the delisting letter, it has seven days to request a hearing with the NASDAQ listing qualification panel to present its case, which postpones the delisting process until the panel makes a decision.</p>\n\n<p>Unless an appeal is filed, <strong>the company&#39;s stock is halted, and then delisted after seven days.</strong> If the appeal is rejected, the company also has the option to appeal to the SEC or in federal court. The NASDAQ gives the company an additional 15 days to do so, but begins its final delisting procedures during that time.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So according to that particular NASDAQ approved source, no Form 25 is required and delist happens 7 days after trading is halted.</p>\n\n<p>But wait there&#39;s more. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Also on the NASDAQ site, in the Listing Center:</p>\n\n<p>An issue will also appear on this list if it has been suspended for failure to meet continued listing requirements or due to other events such as expiration, redemption, or acquisition of the security.</p>\n\n<p>Issues will remain on this list until the first business day after the issue is delisted. <strong>An issue is delisted 10 calendar days from the date the Form 25, Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration, is filed</strong> with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: According to the SEC we should get a Form 25 by end of tomorrow, and according to both the SEC and the NASDAQ Listing Center we don&#39;t delist until 10 days after that. But according to the NASDAQ approved Fool article, posted on the NASDAQ website, we delist next Wednesday and no Form 25 needed.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: maybe these guys just do what the hell they want, at this point it&#39;s kind of what it looks like.</p>\n\n<p>And still no Form 25 posted as of this writing:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/IssuersPendingSuspensionDelisting.aspx\">https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/IssuersPendingSuspensionDelisting.aspx</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Boots Shills \ud83e\ude93\ud83e\ude93\ud83e\ude93", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Thus, the adversary complaint lawsuit will be assigned a different case number and will need to be resolved as a separate matter.\n\n**Adversary complaints seek to block a debtor from receiving a bankruptcy discharge. If successful, the court may issue a judgment against the debtor** that denies them from obtaining a discharge. Such complaints are typically filed by creditors who believe that a debtor has obtained money under false pretenses or fraud, or that the debtor is willfully destroying or giving away property to avoid having a creditor sell it to pay off their debts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom Doc 123:\n\n**Debtor is named herein solely as a nominal defendant and no claims are being asserted against Debtor.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Nominal defendant** is a defendant included in a lawsuit because of a technical connection with the matter in dispute and who is necessary for the court to decide all issues and make a proper judgment. However nominal defendants have no responsibility, no fault, and no right to recovery. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any idea why is this even on the docket?", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
