I guess I wanted to get your guys opinion on this idea. The only rule I would absolutely want is a way to verify that somehow someway you are an ape via share ownership. I dont know how that would happen, but I would want to keep it secure as far as members would go.</p>\n\n<p>Or if anyone else whom is trusted with this community wants to start it up <em>cough</em> pp crew <em>cough</em>, I can transfer these domains off to them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
