I remember falling off Reg Sho because of increased float size by the 100&#39;s of millions. SI dropped like a rock over night.</p>\n\n<p>Well, now that the float size has decreased by the 100&#39;s of millions, and FTD&#39;s most likely increased since being off Reg Sho due to perceived float. I would think, reported FTD&#39;s have increased with the volume and float size during April. Still waiting on the latest report. &quot;Victor from California, Shorts never close. BOOM!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Is there a possibility the stock may end back up on Reg Sho with the lower float and higher FTD rate?  That could get interesting, a suspended stock, heading to OTC? In perfect BBBY fashion, if you reverse uno the float, it does not make less FTD&#39;s. </p>\n\n<p>Basically I am thinking, shorting is allowed on OTC stocks but can make it harder to close a position due to liquidity.  If the float is lower and the FTD report comes in hotter, this surely would increase SI%. There may be an issue closing closing or suppressing the price in OTC because of liquidity.  Throw in a few more ingredients like retail owning the float and you have yourself a squeeze in play? </p>\n\n<p>Not sure of the BBBY vs BBBYQ ticker symbol.
