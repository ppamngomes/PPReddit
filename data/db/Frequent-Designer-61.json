United Fruit Company was the first fruit company that basically dominated the world they vertically integrated their business by buying not just production farms but also steamships, communication companies, rail lines, marketing companies, they vertically integrated the entire company and merged with other companies to become a powerhouse.</p>\n\n<p>What was interesting is at one stage they formed a business trust and bought several companies by taking a 51% ownership of their stock. They then formed a new company called The Fruit Dispatch Company which owned all its stock and became the exclusive selling agent of the United Fruit Company. \u201cYou know what happens when I eat to much fruit\u201d I have to dispatch it.</p>\n\n<p>This explains their history in more detail - <a href=\"https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/usa/history/united-fruit-company.htm\">https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/usa/history/united-fruit-company.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Anyway so the major area of business originally for The United Fruit company was the Bahamas/Caribbean and that\u2019s the map that Icahn had behind him possibly?</p>\n\n<p>Cohen is often seen posting about pirate flags, I found it interesting that United Fruit Company used their transportation ships to also take passengers and their cruise tagline was \u201cWhere The Pirates Hid Their Gold\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>So my theory is that companies like buy buy baby, bbby, blockbuster, toys r us, overstock, party city, Koss, Newell\nmight be bought and rolled into a business trust the selling agent might be GMERICA and they will be bought via a 51% ownership stake and sold exclusively through a GMERICA selling platform that links manufacturing, distribution warehouses, retail hubs ect. A vertically integrated company. </p>\n\n<p>Ryan Cohen \u201cbuys all the stocks\u201d but likely this would be to big to do alone and that\u2019s where Icahn, dragonfly ect ect come in. It needs more capital and firepower to be formed. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe there is something here or maybe I\u2019m just a mungbean drinking the cool aid.</p>\n\n<p>This theory might link in with this - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bobbystock/comments/14xu4p2/bbby_tin_foil_mega_ultra_part_one_gamestop_party/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1\">https://www.reddit.com/r/bobbystock/comments/14xu4p2/bbby_tin_foil_mega_ultra_part_one_gamestop_party/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1</a></p>\n\n<p>God Bless Gmerica.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: said this in a comment below but thought I would add to the main thesis: due to United Fruit Company gaining so much land and power and influence they ended up shifting political powers in small countries which coined the term Banana Republics. It\u2019s interesting that Gmerica is a country like name.</p>\n\n<p>Bonus points: Sam Zemurray came from absolutely nothing to being the president of the company. It\u2019s an amazing story of hard work and grit and seeing opportunity where others don\u2019t - <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/inside_adams/2018/10/sam-the-banana-man/\">https://blogs.loc.gov/inside_adams/2018/10/sam-the-banana-man/</a></p>\n\n<p>Double Bonus Points: The eventual owner of a United Fruit Company was Eli M Black who\u2019s son Leon Black started Apollo Global Management who have been implicated in naked short selling of GME. Leon Black stepped down from his position as CEO in 2021 when it was revealed he financed Jefferey Epstein and his Caribbean island to the tune of 158 million dollars.  </p>\n\n<p>This shit is bananas B A N A N A S!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\u26a0\ufe0f Village idiot \u26a0\ufe0f", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

That\u2019s $580,000 in income taxed at 38.47% so you would receive roughly 356k and you would owe Uncle Sam 223k</p>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s say you wait until you have held those shares for a full year.</p>\n\n<p>In the exact same buy and sell amount you would have 580k of total income but thanks to holding your shares for 12 months or longer you will receive 464k and you would only owe uncle sam 115k.</p>\n\n<p>So just by holding past 12 months could potentially save you 108k in taxes which is a massive amount of savings.</p>\n\n<p>To run these calcs for your own position play around with taxmytendies.com</p>\n\n<p>Now why do I say this because I think everyone needs to consider the long term shareholder value potential that RC or Icahn can create with this play. </p>\n\n<p>I personally highly doubt we will just get \u201cbought out\u201d so to speak, because that implies you getting money and going off into the sunset in your new lambo and never looking back. Whilst I wouldn\u2019t be mad about that, icahn and RC are smarter than that and see value in having loyal long term stock holders, they would want to take us regarded apes with them on the lambo short bus. So to this I personally think we will be receiving shares in GME or IEP or possibly an IPO newly formed company such as Teddy or GMERICA. </p>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s just say you do get stock in a new company you will basically be getting stock at the dirt ground floor before the cornerstone has even been set. If RC or Icahn or a combo of both or more are planning an Amazon competitor you will not be able to pry those shares out of my diamond studded hands because I know they hold incredible long term value.</p>\n\n<p>In closing do what ever you want as far as selling it\u2019s each to their own with their own needs. Just don\u2019t forget about uncle sams cut and also have atleast some consideration for the long term value we could receive in a new firm.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\u26a0\ufe0f Village idiot \u26a0\ufe0f", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Koda Capital and Computershare link - Let the feeding frenzy start", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So today we found out through the Kroll document that Jason Coggins owns 500 MILLION in bonds!</p>\n\n<p>Well who is Jason Coggins? -  <a href=\"https://kodacapital.com/our-team/jason-coggins/\">Jason Coggins - Koda Capital</a> ,  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-coggins-58636164/?originalSubdomain=au\">(2) Jason Coggins | LinkedIn</a> </p>\n\n<p>Well turns out he&#39;s position is Head of Managed Fund Research at Koda Capital a kinda obscure Sydney Australia based investment firm who states they have 10Billion under their advisement. So given the size of the bonds investment of 500 million this is a massive portion of their capital undermanagement invested in these bonds. However looking over their website these guys dont seem to me like your usual bad guys, they for one are completely independent, they pride themselves on honesty and transparency, and they seem to do a lot of non profit/ charity investments. I know a lot of funds do and say this crap but this genuinely seems like this firm is a bit different. Go have a look at their website and decide for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Being an Aussie myself got me thinking Computershare has an office in Melbourne. I wonder if there are any links to Koda and Computershare.

Well in my opinion everyone on the board at Computershare knows very well that GME is close to getting locked up and will moon to the planet Uranus in no time. However being a board member with inside information on the stock you directly register as a service in a strict country like Australia they probably know they can&#39;t eat a piece of this pie without a stomach ache. So what do you do instead, invest in the next big ticket item on RCs hit list and have yourself some BBBYQ.</p>\n\n<p>I believe we are about to enter the feeding frenzy stage of this saga. Those with big time money know a giant squeeze should happen in BBBYQ and they are making sure they are invested to their eyeballs on BBBYQ. As the piece of meat (shares) dwindle (TSO anyone?), the sharks are in the water smelling blood and are about to feast! Only there is a problem, us little plankton have already got a lot of meat in our pockets and we really dont plan on giving it to the sharks unless the price makes sense to us and we no longer have to live as plankton.</p>\n\n<p>TIME TO EAT</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\u26a0\ufe0f Village idiot \u26a0\ufe0f", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WHYiD8Lj_jaO6VUOeZcy9eGWn4TM9Zl7q8Y-mpo0asQ.jpg\"/></div>"},

Well Volaris Capital is run by Vivek Kapoor. So who is Vivek welp hes kind of a slippery character to get information on but here is a link to his Linkedin profile  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-kapoor-61765b6/?originalSubdomain=ae\">(2) VIVEK KAPOOR | LinkedIn</a>  which he is still active on as of 2 months ago.</p>\n\n<p>Vivek was Credit Suisse A.G. as Vice President (Relationship Manager) .  from Oct 2016 - Dec 2020 according to his own linkedin.

Finding anything about his position here is almost impossible, If you apes can find out more about what hes doing at DB please enlighten. </p>\n\n<p>I find it very interesting that this guy has worked closely with Credit Suisse that we are very sure is the prime broker holding a massive bag on GME - let me refer you to this DD -  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ox7p7a/wut_doing_credit_suisse/\">Wut Doing Credit Suisse? \ud83e\udd14 : Superstonk (reddit.com)</a> </p>\n\n<p>Now we know he also works at Deutsche Bank as some sort of mystery VP - who we know are over leveraged to the eye balls  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1202zoh/we_have_seen_that_deutsche_bank_is_24xx_times/\">We have seen that Deutsche Bank is 24.xx times leveraged.

Carl Icahn ended up taking a 26% ownership of the company.</p>\n\n<p>Well around 4 of the board members all came from Herbalife. Including Miguel Fernandez, Pamela Jones Harbour, Richard Goudis ect.

Close all the little stores under the guise of \u201ccost cutting\u201d and underperformance helping out the companies bottom line temporarily whilst workin the media into a frenzy about bankruptcy and all the store closings being a hugely negative sentiment, Then when acquired find new larger sqft spaces to put your megastores in! Expect to see less BBBY locations but consolidated in to much larger stores a place you can get office supplies which also means capturing a whole new market of small businesses, also expect some camping and rec goods.! Then possibly sub lease to lower costs for both BBBY and GME and you have a little section for gaming and merch. \n\nBullish As F", "flair": {"text": "", "text_color": "", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
