Okay... maybe we are still onto something here.

They are the advisors to the creditors committee for BlockFi against FTX?

That&#39;s errrr *interesting*<br/>\n16) Let&#39;s go back to M3 partners and see what else they&#39;ve been up to... Ya know...

If anyone has a link to that, I cannot find it at the moment and would love to include it here.  </p>\n\n<p>My theory is that a lot of companies are seeing that they can clear restrictive liens &amp; covenants by going through CH11 restructuring and swapping predatory lenders for more friendly lenders, who allow for the business to operate without restrictions and gives the ability to unlock capital for growth of the company.   </p>\n\n<p>Maybe VICE is also bought up by Teddy? Maybe VICE is bought by DISH who own the blockbuster IP? Who knows, but there are quite a few cohencidences here to consider. Maybe Instant Brands will be bought up by Newell? Does this explain why the FTC shot down the red balloon in February as a result of monopolistic concerns? None of these are certainties, this is all the strongest grade of black tar copium speculation that you can find, but I hope it helps others consider the wider picture and ramifications of what may be on the table here. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q9if8y3tw96b1.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab6d8303ff575f93d0d1c1f1aca2c3bc80664b37\">Who is looking forward to Teddy Holdings LLC (ENTITY TYPE: BANK)?</a></p>\n\n<p>Oh also, how could I forget Shane Smith&#39;s twitter, the founder and EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN of Vice Media Group   </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3uwwtu1dx96b1.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a8b98019659bded09702a6638966f507a0a884b\">You like whiskey &amp; Baths?
