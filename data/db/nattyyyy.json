What is a reason to not sell during the squeeze, and just hodl. I imagine if it gets to around GameStop&#39;s price, trading will be halted and the price will drop immediately, and although GameStops price rested at a very high value, wouldn&#39;t it have been better to just sell then, and buy back later when it&#39;s cheaper? I understand there&#39;s a MOASS planned but for those of us who just need the money why should I not sell at a couple hundred $?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
