I know there was a lot of hate last night, but to be clear, none of us should be taking financial advice from anyone on the internet. The research and DD has always been meant for us all to review and draw our own conclusions. Nothing has been promised. We should just be thankful that we\u2019re able to share these thoughts and opinions on platforms that allow us to do so freely. We should be thankful that PP and everyone else involved (too many names to type so I apologize in advance for not being more specific.. you know who you are) have given us a platform to do so and spread awareness for what\u2019s going on. We should be a community of likeminded individuals and although potentially losing our hard earned money can be upsetting this was always a zero or hero play. Although I could not contribute the $500 to meet the PP Crew or Pulte, I know that the money will be well spent. The guys deserve some tips for the sacrifices that they made and the time they spent helping us all and I\u2019m confident we will all be rewarded for our patience.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
