Called my broker, they directed me to the company restructuring line. Called the Kroll restructuring helpline, they directed me to <a href=\"mailto:bbbyinfo@ra.kroll.com\">bbbyinfo@ra.kroll.com</a>. Emailed bbbyinfo and got an autoreply saying that the email isn\u2019t monitored anymore and I won\u2019t recieve a response. Called the restructuring line again, told them I followed every instruction of theirs to a dead end, they said they cannot help as they are just a third party. Anyone else run into this issue or figure out a way to get their ID?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
