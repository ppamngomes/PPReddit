Also I get real sketched out when they &quot;simulate&quot; scenarios these days. Looks like a possible playbook of an upcoming event.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Related Content: Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests 2023: <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2023.htm\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/dfa-stress-tests-2023.htm</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
