This includes: groceries, hygiene products, rent, water, electricity, repairs/replacements, healthcare, phone bill, internet bill and similar \u201chas to be paid\u201d bills or standards of modern households. May be expanded as needed in terms of healthcare or other individual necessities. Pay off ongoing loans in full, don\u2019t lose money on interest. Also, buy high quality groceries. Your nutrition and health are important. </p></li>\n<li><p>Invest in commodities. <strong>Own</strong> a home. Make it a nice one, it will not only improve your quality of life but also be a stable value commodity. Rare metals (in physical form), real estate and partial reinvestment in stocks (good ones, like Teddy, GME, etc.), as well as multiple bank accounts protected by FDIC with compounding interest. Control your spending by an automated money transfer to a \u201cspending account\u201d. This will help you keep track.</p></li>\n<li><p>Fuck luxury cars or yachts. Keep a low profile in day-to-day life. Letting others see your wealth attracts fake friends and grifters while being dangerous at the same time. People will do anything for your money. Keep quiet as much as you can, show as little as possible to the public. </p></li>\n<li><p>You still want luxuries? Fine. Be smart about it. Buying a $500k car means you will need a lot of cash for gas, repairs, insurance etc. Make it a calculated decision, run the numbers for at least 5-10 years to come. Having $500k doesn\u2019t mean you can afford a $500k car long term. And don\u2019t park it in front of your home. Get a garage, you can afford it. Keep it safe and away from too many eyes. And don\u2019t think this is overkill or paranoid, if you were an armed robber which house would you pick? That\u2019s right. </p></li>\n<li><p>Take care of your loved ones. The ones you trust. Make sure they\u2019re healthy. If they can\u2019t afford necessities of life or are struggling with groceries or medical bills, you know what to do. But be careful, limit yourself to your close loved ones. It\u2019s easy to try and fix everything around you, but you can\u2019t and it\u2019s risky. Don\u2019t let people take advantage of you. As always, keep your profile as low as possible. </p></li>\n<li><p>Get a job. Not a \u201cI need money to survive\u201d job. A real job, something that fulfills you. Something that matters to you. You now have the luxury of being independent, so find something to spend your time with. Take the necessary steps (necessary degrees or similar) and do it. You will need a purpose for yourself with all that money, so find one. </p></li>\n<li><p>Lay off bad habits. I know it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, I\u2019m a smoker myself. Alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, whatever it is. Get rid of it, get clean if that applies to you and work on yourself. Replace bad habits with healthy ones, get to the gym, visit support groups if necessary, make sure you can use what you achieved to the fullest. And I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t have a beer or a little weed, but everything has its limits and moderation is key. </p></li>\n<li><p>Last rule, this is my individual rule book. Yours might differ, but I strongly suggest you <strong>write</strong> one for yourself. I believe my points are important and I am by no means saying this list is complete. But it\u2019s a start. Happy to hear feedback. Stay healthy, this world needs you. </p></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Let's collect some theories and opinions.", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So CTB has been a central indicator for squeeze plays like GME and BBBY for 84 years now. There&#39;s always been some kind of correlation with the price but none that was clear enough to pinpoint. </p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve seen CTB rocketing and subsequent or simultaneous price rocketing in the past but we&#39;ve also seen CTB spikes with sideways or even down movement.</p>\n\n<p>So if we take simple principle of supply and demand, we could theorize the following:</p>\n\n<p>1) Huge share demand to suppress upcoming price surge --&gt; higher CTB --&gt; price will boom soon </p>\n\n<p>2) Sudden decrease in available shares (through DRS surge for example) --&gt; low supply --&gt; high CTB</p>\n\n<p>3) Lenders raise CTB because why not, free money, demand is high anyway. Especially when price will move soon and hedgies know</p>\n\n<p>4) Manipulation of CTB to mislead people into diverting from real play to scam plays (see AMSneed and AA)</p>\n\n<p>5) ????</p>\n\n<p>So, you guys got any more theories? I think the current situation mimics the last august runup, but other explanations seem logical as well. But then again, how come there&#39;s been times where CTB didn&#39;t do shit to the price? </p>\n\n<p>Drop your thoughts peeps and hodl for the ride</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
