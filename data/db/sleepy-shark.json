In the 90&#39;s one man triggered the collapse of England&#39;s oldest bank, Barings. He was not sorry (and probably still isn&#39;t). The fear he felt was fleeting. The banking and finance sector tends to attract Cluster B personalities. If you don&#39;t want to watch a few minutes for context and just cut to what I mean fast forward to 19:34. Don&#39;t get hung up on making them feel fear or sorry, they don&#39;t experience those kind of things (or anything really) like a normal person. I think what I&#39;m trying to say is don&#39;t drink poison in order to hurt someone because it only hurts you in the end. Look to the future and what you&#39;re going to do to better your life and society&#39;s. The ultimate form of revenge for people like this is to live well, literally. Why? Because they don&#39;t experience real happiness or love like a normal person. It makes them irate and uncomfortable, because they can only mimic these things rather than experience them. They are broken people and statistically unlikely to ever be whole, because the majority of them don&#39;t respond to treatment or flat out refuse it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/avMbu6cc4Eo?si=Fg-6w4UncmCTut47\">How A 28 Year Old Man Destroyed England&#39;s Oldest Bank</a>\nTime Stamps:\n7:26\n9:43\n11:03 \n19:34</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://psychcentral.com/disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder/when-a-narcissist-sees-you-happy#tips-for-dealing-with-a-narcissist\">What to Do When a Narcissist Sees You Happy</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

They&#39;re doing it to paint anyone who doesn&#39;t follow them as an unintelligent and misguided overly trusting fool. It comes off as incredibly fake (and pretty annoying) to us, it&#39;s like an <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley\">uncanny valley</a> of emotions, but to someone who is an outsider it may make sense, because they&#39;re not as invested in this. Manipulative people with <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320508#:%7E:text=Cluster%20B%3A%20A%20person%20with,histrionic%2C%20and%20narcissistic%20personality%20disorders.\">Cluster B personality disorders</a> and toxic people do stuff like this.

We&#39;ve given our stances and they completely ignore the argument. In place of something to counteract our points they resort to using ridicule, <a href=\"https://www.floridawomenslawgroup.com/the-narcissists-word-salad/#:%7E:text=The%20narcissist%20uses%20a%20word,you%20or%20say%20something%20mean.\">word salad</a>, or they completely ignore what was said. If they actually cared and respected us they would leave us alone and move on to something else. So why are they coming back again and again? Because they want us to let go of something valuable to save their skins. We are fully aware of the risks and we have whole heatedly chosen to not only accept these risks but to trust our due diligence and instincts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
