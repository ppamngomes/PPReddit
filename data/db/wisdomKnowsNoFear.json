I\u2019m merely trying to bring attention to some of the connections that have raised my eyebrow. My hope is others will put eyes on this and assist with further digging.</p>\n\n<p>This is a discussion about tZERO, Overstock, and associated parties. I first began looking into this because of Marc Cohodes involvement in tZERO, and his continued public bashing of Ryan Cohen on X (formerly Twitter), since the early days of the GME saga began. This did not sit well with me, as discussions of tZERO&#39;s securities platform rollout has aligned with other events/timelines with our company, Overstock&#39;s purchase of the Bed Bath IP, etc; so I thought it&#39;d be prudent to look into connections further.</p>\n\n<h1>Marc Cohodes</h1>\n\n<p>Mark was a well known short who ran a (primarily) short hedge fund for around 25 years, up until it was blown up in the late 2000\u2019s with a large short campaign against Overstock. There was suspected naked short selling, and a short and distort campaign occurring; and long story short, Goldman Sachs around the time of the GFC, ghosted Cohodes and force closed his short position on Overstock when the stock ran, prior to it crashing (as they were suspected to be naked, and ultimately at risk as the Prime Broker). Overstock subsequently sued several parties, including Cohodes, in which he was deposed in 2011. I would encourage everyone to read the deposition (I know it&#39;s lengthy), but it provides a great window into the market mechanics and how Prime Brokers and Market Makers are manipulating the markets, with regulators looking the other way.

Was suspected of participating in a short and distort campaign against the company, was blown up by his Prime Broker, and subsequently sued by Overstock (who has been known to loath and advocate against naked shorting).</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward, and Cohodes is now an advocate of tZERO (owned by Overstock), even ringing the bell with the team at the NYSE:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4o6bcq4qtkwb1.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34819bb994ae17238bc2214e9983b918d1a51098\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/4o6bcq4qtkwb1.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34819bb994ae17238bc2214e9983b918d1a51098\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/4o6bcq4qtkwb1.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34819bb994ae17238bc2214e9983b918d1a51098\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Potential connection to Citadel:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cqpekxttukwb1.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b45d789aed91e6d655841c839a49fe57751c912\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/cqpekxttukwb1.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b45d789aed91e6d655841c839a49fe57751c912\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/cqpekxttukwb1.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b45d789aed91e6d655841c839a49fe57751c912\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Cohodes also came to the defense of short sellers in Feb 2021 during the Gamestop saga:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0fl6g18lvkwb1.png?width=1352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01771021291f63cb103f3c2b2c7d875a92da2835\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/0fl6g18lvkwb1.png?width=1352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01771021291f63cb103f3c2b2c7d875a92da2835\" alt=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/business/shortseller-marc-cohodes-strikes-back-against-attacks-in-the-wake-of-the-reddit-gamestop-saga-b918506.html\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I think it is clear he is not a friend of Gamestop, Ryan Cohen, and potentially BBBY. His involvement with an Overstock Company tZERO, and Overstock&#39;s purchase of Bed Bath IP, in my mind, makes it worth looking further into these associated companies and people. I also find it VERY interesting that he was against Overstock, and after getting blown up in the late 2000&#39;s, is back and is one of their subsidiaries biggest cheer leaders?? Something doesn&#39;t add up there.</p>\n\n<p>Cohodes disdain for Ryan Cohen (I&#39;m sure there are more, but here&#39;s a few for reference):</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u04yz25y4lwb1.png?width=1394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f2e2d700f5c840f8998ffcabe0b72a80cad51ca\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/u04yz25y4lwb1.png?width=1394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f2e2d700f5c840f8998ffcabe0b72a80cad51ca\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/u04yz25y4lwb1.png?width=1394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f2e2d700f5c840f8998ffcabe0b72a80cad51ca\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yv8mjt1s4lwb1.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99f4ac32b35924d122475ee408a8d2184a3ae542\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/yv8mjt1s4lwb1.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99f4ac32b35924d122475ee408a8d2184a3ae542\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/yv8mjt1s4lwb1.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99f4ac32b35924d122475ee408a8d2184a3ae542\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ci0wfrpj4lwb1.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abc9aa19f16efb94179c67764b0b8f4ed714c32b\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/ci0wfrpj4lwb1.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abc9aa19f16efb94179c67764b0b8f4ed714c32b\" alt=\"https://preview.redd.it/ci0wfrpj4lwb1.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abc9aa19f16efb94179c67764b0b8f4ed714c32b\"></a></p>\n\n<h1>tZERO</h1>\n\n<p>tZERO is owned by Overstock with a few other minor holders.

This connection interests me, as RC has tweated several references to Buffet including &quot;Warren Ichan&quot; by night (which I took as a favorable mention), and his &quot;thumb war&quot; challenge tweet. The trading around BRK has been interesting (I did quite a bit of write up on this on another sub over a year ago - you can check my early post history). I&#39;m not sure if all of this puts Buffet and Byrne on the right or wrong side of the play, but the connections are intersting, and discussion worthy none the less.</p>\n\n<p>Overstock has a lot of subsidiary companies, and those people and companies have questionable connections to bad actors as pointed out herein. I&#39;m not saying Overstock is a bad actor, I&#39;m purely trying to provide connections and open the dialog for further exploration given they were the purchaser of IP, and run a blockchain trading platform that many here speculate to be potential location for new shares.</p>\n\n<h1>Marcus Lemonis</h1>\n\n<p>Let me preface this by saying I&#39;m a fan of Marcus, and I genuinely want to like him. There are a couple of associations that give me pause, and cause me to proceed with caution. I listened to the Pulte and Marcus X space call a week or so ago. There was one comment that stood out to me as a blaring red flag. He made a comment about being die-hard loyal to JP Morgan and Jamie Diamon, based on his experience dealing with the bank during the GFC, and subsequently years later, a call and help Diamon made to Lemonis. Listen to the conversation starting at 1:14:30 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O19o-c-6gPQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O19o-c-6gPQ</a>. As we&#39;re all aware, it&#39;s speculated that JP Morgan was a major driver in their debt arrangement associated with the destruction of BBBY.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Marcus&#39;s shows are on CNBC, the same network perpetuating fake news about Ryan Cohen and Gamestop, as well as the Employer of Jim Cramer. Not that you can&#39;t have a show on CNBC and still be a good guy, but he clearly isn&#39;t on the bad side of the powers that be.</p>\n\n<p>Marcus joined the Overstock board, and the resounding questions is, is Marcus good, is Overstock good, or are there reasons for pause on all accounts?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I thank you for taking the time to read this, and further digging that may occur.

It&#39;s grossly being overlooked, and I&#39;m confident has a high probability of success. I have market sector numbers to backup my claim and a framework for what I&#39;d envision to be a successful rollout ( and a successful rollout to me means, speed to market with a quality that will delight customers, low cost to implement, quick generation of free positive cashflow, and highly positive PR - it enhances the brand image).</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t want to broadcast this to others, and doubt you would (or have the time) to reach out directly, but if you had one of your team members reach out, I&#39;d be happy to get the ball rolling!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the consideration, </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A committed investor and team member, ready to put in WORK for my company</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>PS.

I will instead shout it from the proverbial mountaintop.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a person of few words (until I&#39;m not), and prefer anonymity over the public spotlight. With that, I&#39;d like to take a moment to say THANK YOU for your unwavering commitment. You&#39;ve taken time out of your days and weeks, to host a platform that gives real, regular, individuals, from all walks of life, a platform to express their opinion on a stock (right, wrong, or indifferent). I&#39;m not sure you understand how powerful this is (or perhaps you do). For he individual investor who is inundated by the propaganda machine, that is the main stream media, forcing their narrative with intent on driving people&#39;s actions in a predetermined direction for their benefit; it is being stopped in its tracks by what you&#39;ve so carefully crafted with this show. It allows people to discuss points and counterpoints, dive into the details, hypothesize and find material support, or debunk those hypothesis. In search of truth, whether it supports our bias or not, is what we&#39;re all really after here. Being able to openly discuss ideas, and have the hive mind, from all walks of life and backgrounds, add pieces to the puzzle, gives clarity to the picture and strengthens the resolve of those that take the time to gain the wisdom. As my username implies &quot;wisdom knows no fear&quot;. By gaining wisdom (which this platform is helping facilitate), it removes the fear and emotion from the decision making process; something main stream media has long relied on stoking. When you have the wisdom, you know no fear!</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been a long time lurker. In the saga since Feb 2021, through multiple GME sub migrations, DRS&#39;d prior to DRS being in vogue, and invested in BBBY shortly after RC entered his position (I still hold). I believe in him, and the people he surrounds himself with. I believe in you, and all that have participated in making this sub special. You&#39;ve been a magnet that has truly attracted a genuine group of individuals, that have the right heart, are extremely intelligent, and will prevail in the long term, regardless of the outcome of BBBYQ. Thank you PP, and please continue being genuine, and doing what you do. As <a href=\"/u/realpulte\">u/realpulte</a> stated, you&#39;re going places my friend, I can attest to that. You and the rest of this sub that participate and put in the work, are appreciated more than you know! Thank you! Travel safe, and enjoy Moonday (Monday)!</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to give a special shout out and show gratitude also for the following folks (though I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing many more deserving individuals):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/ppseeds\">u/ppseeds</a> for his unwavering commitment</p>\n\n<p>Michael for his unwavering support</p>\n\n<p>ABC for his unwavering strength</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/travis_b13\">u/travis_b13</a> for his unwavering analytics (and unwavering timing - spoiler alert)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/jake2b\">u/jake2b</a> for his unwavering logic and organized delivery</p>\n\n<p>Sal for his UNWAIVERING CONVICTION</p>\n\n<p>okbet for his unwavering insight</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/realpulte\">u/realpulte</a> for his unwavering kindness</p>\n\n<p>RC for his unwavering will, drive, and integrity (and so much more)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/hey_ross\">u/hey_ross</a> for his unwavering wisdom</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/baseballmal21\">u/baseballmal21</a> for his unwavering confidence</p>\n\n<p>And everyone in this sub for participating in a genuine conversation to find truth; for your love, and for your kindness.
