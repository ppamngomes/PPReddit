I would like to put some minds at ease. </p>\n\n<p>First the Null, Void, and Worthless (NVW) Letter is listed underneath the DTC reorganization page. <a href=\"https://www.dtcc.com/settlement-and-asset-services/agent-services/corporate-action-information-for-agents\">https://www.dtcc.com/settlement-and-asset-services/agent-services/corporate-action-information-for-agents</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>There is a reason why Mr. Sandler only used a screenshot of the NVW Questionnaire instead of the actual NVW Letter. The letter could have tipped their hand prior to them being ready to execute. Equiniti must send an email of the NVW Letter to one of the below applicable email addresses within the DTC. \u00a0The form and contents of the NVW letter must not be altered or edited and is not negotiable.  The Three applicable email addresses are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>[<a href=\"mailto:redemptionnotification@dtcc.com\">redemptionnotification@dtcc.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:redemptionnotification@dtcc.com\">redemptionnotification@dtcc.com</a>).\u00a0\u00a0</p></li>\n<li><p>[<a href=\"mailto:conversionsandwarrantsannouncements@dtcc.com\">conversionsandwarrantsannouncements@dtcc.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:conversionsandwarrantsannouncements@dtcc.com\">conversionsandwarrantsannouncements@dtcc.com</a>)</p></li>\n<li><p>[<a href=\"mailto:mandatoryreorgannouncements@dtcc.com\">mandatoryreorgannouncements@dtcc.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:3.mandatoryreorgannouncements@dtcc.com\">3.mandatoryreorgannouncements@dtcc.com</a>)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Below is the mandatory first paragraph of the NVW. I believe the NVW letter was sent to email #3 and will show the company is undergoing a reorganization.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Please accept this letter as our authorization of The Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) to delete the entire position for the above-referenced CUSIP (\u201cRequest\u201d). Due to/In accordance with/As a result of [COMPANY to insert reason or background, e.g., identify the specific bankruptcy or liquidation event, expiration, terms of the offering document, etc.], the securities are null, void, and worthless.  There will be no future payments. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I still think we are on glide path in accordance with the plan. Hope this is helpful, or someone can follow up and learn more about the NVW process. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
