Banning shills and bots is good, but even illustrated one of your mods was disagreeing with silencing someone. It gives the community a bad look if anything remotely bearish is immediately slandered instead of being legitimately addressed with facts and arguments, and part of the reason people think we're a cult lol. \n\nAgain, I love the show and everyone on it, but regardless of who is silenced it won't change the stock price. Having bearz on once a month isn't really enough (imo) to say that the show openly displays both sides. It's important to stay grounded (we filed bankruptcy and my portfolio has taken a nose dive, like most people here) and it's easy to get swept away by the hype sometimes.", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

There are a few things that could have happened to them, feel free to correct me because I'm likely missing something and made mistakes here.\n\n1. They were exercised at 6.15 (unlikely)\n2. Standard cashless exercise (I'm pretty sure this isn't possible unless the share price is above the warrant price)\n3. Alternate cashless exercise (I'm still trying to understand how this works, so hopefully someone with a bigger brain than me can add to this)\n\nfrom the s-1:\n\n\" In addition, whether or not a Registration Statement is effective, the holder may exercise on an \u201calternate cashless exercise\u201d basis (\u201cAlternate Cashless Exercise\u201d and together with \u201cStandard Cashless Exercise,\u201d the \u201cCashless Exercise\u201d), in which case the number of shares issuable shall equal the product of (x) the number of shares of common stock then issuable upon a Cash Exercise and (y) 0.65.\"\n\nThe way I interpret this is that the warrant holder doesn't have to put down any money, but receives 65% of the shares that they otherwise would have if they exercised normally or with a standard cashless exercise. In this case, it would be 80 million-ish shares for the warrant holders instead of the original 122-ish million (ignoring the few un-exercised warrants left, i dont feel like doing the math) but BBBY doesn't receive any money for it. I also read (not in the filing) that other assets, like shares of another company, can be exchanged in place of cash to exercise the warrants.  \n\n4. They could have been cancelled, which they would reveal during earnings. \n\nBased on my very limited understanding of this, I don't see any realistic scenario where BBBY received money for these warrants. I hope I'm wrong, so please somebody come tear down everything I said so that I can huff cope and convince myself BoBBY is sitting on an extra 700 million dollars.", "flair": {"text": "", "text_color": "", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
