This is incredibly bullish since the shares might be held at the transfer agent/the trust account of the plan administrator/or a custodian (Teddy is registered as a bank \ud83d\udc40)</p>\n\n<p>We don\u2019t know how long the shares are held but:\n1. The transfer agent and the broker has to keep a record of the shares and who it\u2019s owned by\n2. If we do get new shares distributed, brokers legally have to distribute them to you because if they don\u2019t it\u2019ll be like taking cash out of your chequing account and they can get into A LOT of trouble </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I think because the Neelay Das hearing is on Oct 31, we probably wouldn\u2019t get our shares until it is settled and there is an amendment of the plan on paper. Even if the shares are gone for a long time I am totally confident about the play because:</p>\n\n<p>There are 3.5 bn NOLs to be exploited, even Pulte had mentioned the NOLs</p>\n\n<p>The JPM lien is gone, it was the main setback for any M&amp;A transaction to take place, that was the reason why they had to undergo chapter 11, to remove the predatory lien through the bankruptcy courts. If the company wanted to fully liquidate, why pay off the JPM loan?</p>\n\n<p>RC is 200% involved, he was listed as a creditor, and interested party and Pulte has been spending a lot of time out of his busy schedule running businesses and charities to interact with the BBBYQ community. His reputation is at stake here because when you are that rich, the two most valuable things to you is time and reputation. Furthermore, RC had liked Pulte\u2019s tweets about BBBY and Pulte had asked people to donate to PP\u2019s stream in order to meet him in November. If something positive was not going to happen, a LOT of people who donated will be really mad. Why risk his reputation like that? </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m really excited to see how things go. I have half a mil in this play and my biggest regret is that I didn\u2019t take out another loan and put 7 figures in this. One of the most important factors in success is the ability to take in pain. Following this stock is a traumatic experience but this is a highly risky play and even though it\u2019s easy making 2% yearly gains investing in an ETF, only by investing in the underdog that everybody overlooks is there potential to make REAL money.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s super scary to see the shares out of our accounts but just trust the process.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you all have a great weekend!

But you have to remember that originally, if the company was able to pay off the JPM ABL, then they would do a 1/10 or 1/20 reverse split and then there would be a 1 billion dollar offering from B Riley. The S-1 mentioned a fundamental transaction taking place before the offering (perhaps buyout or spinoff) and B Riley underwritten the IPO for <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/15/2109355/0/en/Spartacus-Acquisition-Corporation-Announces-Pricing-of-200-000-000-Initial-Public-Offering.html\">Spartacus Acquisition, where Shelly Lombard (a board RC had appointed and is still there,</a>  was the board of directors. B Riley is a relatively unknown investment bank, not even in the top 100 rankings when I searched only, I doubt it\u2019s a coincidence the same person used B Riley for two large IPOs.</p>\n\n<p>In the original standstill agreement between RC and BBBY, there was a clause that says Ben and Marjorie are in charge of the acquisition parts but Shelly\u2019s role was not specified. Shelly was the only director appointed by RC left probably because due to the JPM M/A restrictions, there was no way Ben or Marjorie could do an MA through normal means (which was why Carol and Holly joined the team)</p>\n\n<p>Even if we start trading OTC, if there is a successful buyout then there would be an IPO underwritten by B Riley for the company\u2019s new subsidiary Baby though I think it would be renamed as TEDDY. Unfortunately because the float is so diluted, I think we would get 1/10 or 1/20 new shares, which was also kind of the reason for the RS to take place.</p>\n\n<p>Chill, enjoy your weekend and this month would be funny in hindsight when you think about it in your Ferraris.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#94e044"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

But since the chapter 11 filing, Flaton is the disinterested director overseeing the operation and Etlin is the company&#39;s CFO and CRO in charge of the financials of the case everything suddenly clicked. The purpose of these two joining the board was to bypass a way to sell the company outside of JPM&#39;s permission through chapter 11!</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also the timing of RC&#39;s tweets that coincide with every BBBY filing, the references to the Titanic in RC&#39;s tweets and the way Sue referred to the company in court, the Protocol Gemini Tweet, the IG stories of Teddy and Ryan or Carl. I&#39;d love to list them all out and dissect but I don&#39;t have the time today and I&#39;ve been clean off of amphetamines for years now.</p>\n\n<p>It kind of makes sense why there were two separate plans, r/S and B Riley deal would&#39;ve occurred if the company was able to pay off JPM to free Baby and spin it off. The chapter 11 was if they couldn&#39;t be able to pay off JPM.
