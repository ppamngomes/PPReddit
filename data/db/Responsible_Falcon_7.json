On paper, household investors do not own this company", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Everyone in this play wants it to be over already. With GME the price is just too expensive to lock the float any time soon for everyone who believes in DRS. BBBYQ on the other hand is a different story. </p>\n\n<p>There is finally a chance for shareholders to end this play with the price of BBBYQ so low. There should be more than enough shares bought between this group to lock the entire float and prove once and for all, to the world and the courts, that naked shorting exists. </p>\n\n<p>To DRS is selfless and is the type of long sighted thinking that aligns with Ryan Cohen\u2019s values. I myself plan on letting RC sell company shares into MOASS to create a massive company. I will live off of dividends. It\u2019s that simple. With 90,000 DRSed shares, there is no need for me to sell within 5-10 years and I can transfer back to a broker at anytime if the price does get to my selling price.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly in all of this is that it is up to retail to protect what is OURS. By DRSing. And this company should be ours. NOT the broker\u2019s. NOT the hedge fund\u2019s. Not the DTCC\u2019s. OURs! But right now it is not. On paper, household shareholders do NOT own this company. Not completely. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: if you want to actually end this as soon as possible, household investors need to own this company by DRSing. DRSing the float could be the final catalyst that blows this scandal wide open.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/msf5md0yd1pb1.jpg\"/></div>"}]
