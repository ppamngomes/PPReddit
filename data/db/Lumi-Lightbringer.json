As it came out of bankruptcy, some Hedge funds decided to save the company and save countless jobs with restructuring and offer even free cash to the company, just so they could make it. And they did. The stonk mooned and hedge funds were happy, but not fur long... a group of apes mobilized and said &quot;F#CK THIS COMPANY!&quot; and opened a shittonne of short positions, trying to kill it.  Hedge funds and media were in panic, spreading information why it is bad to short the company.<br/>\n&quot;Please dont short it! People need this company!

These grifters are pumping out articles with their AIs all over the place to just create doubt in people. These here that I listed are most prominent and daily pump out shitty articles. The really go after your investments so that they can benefit (whoever is behind these fake news).<br/>\nThere is also clear silence before something positive happens to the stock. You dont hear anything. Then suddenly the stock explodes and later you get the &quot;Oh it happened because ... xyz&quot; but its also just a rubbish explanation.<br/>\nIn the Hertz example you can clearly see what they have done. During the time of uncertainty they have pumped out so many shitty articles like with BBBY so that people sell for a loss and they get in and get all the money or minimize their losses. Thats all it is about.<br/>\nLook at the wording its always the same, its always dramatic and is intended to awake fear in you.  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;IT IS BANKRUPT!&quot;// &quot;ITS OVER!&quot; // &quot;SELL NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE&quot; // WIPES OUT SHAREHOLDERS // &quot;YOU GOT FOOLED.&quot; and so on...<br/>\nyou get the story and you live the story.  </p>\n\n<p>This should be forbidden imo. Misleading people like that on purpose so they lose their money. Giving continiously wrong financial advice or &quot;half truths&quot;. Yeah I think half truths gives them the ability to walk around in the grey area.  </p>\n\n<p>I for example dont read these news much. I just use them to confirm my trades lol. When they say &quot;SELL&quot; and Im bullish because I did TA on that, its a little sweet confirmation. Using their weapon against them lmao</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/SSfPj50KqUeU9zfOnJhpfdtZ0_BYMZ4iAIR4CqcD3g8.jpg\"/></div>"},

Why are shorts right and wrong?", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I think it is very important to distinguish what these companies are doing. Why the whole company went bankrupt and which parts of the company made money, and which didnt.   </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n7gm9ic7w3zb1.png?width=1626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2a17681b5f23f5faadf799ab1f467f26ded09c4\">Bed Bath Beyond</a></p>\n\n<p>So Overstock acquired this part of Bed Bath Beyond.<br/>\nWhat do we see here? Ive browsed through and specifically hit this part for Kids &amp; Babies.<br/>\nIts furniture. Its home goods. Only that. What did Overstock do? Selling furnitures.  Both go hand in hand. Beyond is used as a marketing name. All of that makese sense.<br/>\nThrough bad business management BedBathBeyond went down. The bankruptcy plan was in my opinion a plan to divide this company and its subsidiary.<br/>\nThe subsidiary which is called BuyBuyBaby, had a valuation of 1billion dollars. It was the subsidiary that was keeping BedBathBeyond alive. BedBathBeyond didnt sell enough stuff and was not profitable. Only its subsidiary.  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b7xj7gj1x3zb1.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ea3c2e81e35ba8c8bdc7aa31bce76b76487b82b\">BuyBuyBaby</a></p>\n\n<p>I fetched this old website from BuyBuyBaby to show you something. What are they doing? You can clearly see a difference in what they are selling and what is BedBathBeyond selling.<br/>\nThis part of BedBathBeyond was more profitable than BedBathBeyond itself.<br/>\nSo Imagine you have a big company and a small company within. But your main business is failing and the small company is making all the profits. Overtime its not good and we see what happened.   </p>\n\n<p>Does BuyBuyBaby deserve to go bankrupt aswell? I think not. Why should a company that is actually profitable go down because of your parent company being unprofitable?   </p>\n\n<p>So It is necessary to understand that BedBathBeyond as the parent company has worthless shares.<br/>\n<strong>BUT!!!</strong>  Do shareholders deserve to get evaporated because the parent company is unprofitable?<br/>\nWhen they bought BedBathBeyond they also bought BuyBuyBaby.<br/>\nAnd BuyBuyBaby was profitable and worth something. That part is clearly not bankrupt, it can also function on its own. And here comes the neat part.  </p>\n\n<p>How can this company come back to life? Another company needs to merge with it. All the worthy assets are shifted. Because the worthless shares have indeed some value, just not with BedBathBeyond, but with BuyBuyBaby, these shares would be used and merged with the value of the company merging with.   </p>\n\n<p>Maybe an illustration will help:  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9j5uok6iz3zb1.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e654c2bcef05c7cc6977fa6f983d37e00f423bb\">Illustration</a></p>\n\n<p>And this is why I believe we didnt see anyone posting gains and profits of shorting bedbathbeyond.<br/>\nThey got all the same treatment of the &quot;unknown&quot; as we do.<br/>\nThe game is not over and people claiming that are clearly wrong.   </p>\n\n<p>So what I wanna make clear here, why were the shares labeled worthless? Because there needs to be a recalculation. BuyBuyBaby was acquired and the worth of that one is absolutely greater than the worth of the parent company named BedBathBeyond.<br/>\nMeaning post merger, the shares need to be merged with the value of the company acquiring it to either<br/>\n1) Go Public trading or 2) Offer cash to shareholders and stay private<br/>\nSince offering cash to shareholders might be unprofitable I go with the option 1.<br/>\nThe new company will reverse merge IPO and get a new ticker. That ticker will be containing the shares of the old BedBathBeyond (BBBY) because that is BuyBuyBaby. Overstock has nothing to do with that anymore. Overstock got its part. But BuyBabyBaby the true value hodler, deserves its own part.   </p>\n\n<p>I hope I could make my theory clear here.<br/>\nMedia is silent because of this one. Brokers&amp;Banks are wrongfully and rightfully being told &quot;Shares worthless, delete them from portfolio&quot;<br/>\n1) Its true, shares are worthless<br/>\n2) They dont give the second info. Which leads to confusion for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>So imo, shorts r still fuk and when they wake up one day with a giant minus in their accounts, then we will see the outcome.   </p>\n\n<p>Now the difference:<br/>\nWere shorts right to short this to bankruptcy? Yes and no.<br/>\nThey shorted an unprofitable parent company that is called BedBathBeyond. The shorts were 99% right in their decision. But the 1% is the turning point. The subsidiary that is more worth that its parent company got shorted with it and thats why shorts will lose despite being right.<br/>\nThis was the ultimate beartrap. The ones that escaped and closed their position during the ETORO interview were in the luck. The rest that held on shorting will see what is going to happen to them.</p>\n\n<p>:)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/N2aG77BrMkWB9zgxOiAzHgcHX2ExLYqrZ5TMQ-RcyUs.jpg\"/></div>"},

As they on their own dont have any value. And you wont be getting them ever again (BBBY). What you get instead is the new form.  Which form it will be is yet to be determined. Thats why brokers and banks probably dont know anything.<br/>\nSo the new form can be in form of cash or new issued shares.  <em>(Kevin Malone Client Merger pic)</em><br/>\nRecalculated Debt, Assetvalue, Ratio etc.<br/>\nthen the merger and then you get something new.<br/>\nI hope they do that as quickly as they removed them.<br/>\nThen I wonder what the hell they will talk in the media about.   </p>\n\n<p>They will crash the market and try to steal some money.<br/>\nSo Im positive we will receive the new form of money. And pay attention what the market will do.<br/>\nNov 1st. is FOMC (Federal Reserve Interest Decision Meeting). I think it is very timely now for them to announce cuts in interest rates and rug the market. If not now then in December, but the inevitable is coming.<br/>\nThey do that so they can take then new loans and pump the market back up with the lower interest rates. So we will see a new cycle of bull run and a new cycle of inflation which will drag along a few years. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Thats what a wise man would do.... so Ive been thinking!  </p>\n\n<p>All these low commission trading platforms and even banks dont have the shares on hand.<br/>\nThey dont have them until they HAVE to BUY them so you can directly register them.  </p>\n\n<p>Ive managed only through InteractiveBrokers to actually DRS, even while OTC.<br/>\nBut the rest of my shares are now trapped. Ive tried 2 months now to DRS and they didnt do it. Now they give me lame excuses why its not possible.  </p>\n\n<p>So the next step is what Im waiting for, how they wanna liquidate my position while company is expecting merger as some people posted here. And even I expect that to happen.  </p>\n\n<p>So there is a following scenario:  </p>\n\n<p>They delete your shares and say<br/>\n<em>- &quot;yeah your shares are removed from the portfolio because its worth nothing&quot;.</em><br/>\n<strong>So what are they gonna do when the merger happens?</strong><br/>\nYour shares are your shares man. If you took a dump and put it in the package, and put in the bank. And a month later you go to that bank and say: Yeah, id like my sh#t back and take it to another bank.<br/>\nThe bank goes then:<br/>\n<em>- &quot;But we thought its just crap, and the cleaning staff removed it from your drawer.&quot;</em>  </p>\n\n<p>Then suddenly you got famous and your sh#t is worth thousands of dollars and your bank just removed it. </p>\n\n<p>HEY I WANT MY SH#T BACK, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? MY SH#T!  </p>\n\n<p>So they have to reproduce my sh#t or buy the same sh#t at the market and then they go broke and because the price keeps skyrocketing (TEDDY) and thats not even a shortsqueeze. Thats a broker/bank squeeze because they dont have your stuff on hand that YOU BOUGHT WITH YOUR MONEY.  </p>\n\n<p>So they end up BROKE AND IN PRISON FOR CRIMES!<br/>\nAnd to think this ponzi scheme has been going on since for ever, makes me just angry man.<br/>\nPension funds, investments, all fake unless DRS.   </p>\n\n<p>So with BBBYs situation, they cannot just go on the market and get your shares and act like nothing happened and register them and hide their crimes under the carpet.<br/>\nHaha, they really thought they could pull this off for ever. What a damn ponzi scheme.  </p>\n\n<p>Collective SUEING is what I would suggest. Dont let them get away with your shares and just delete them if these shares are meant to become different shares for a different company.<br/>\n<strong>If we are getting a merger, if we should get our shares, then these guys have no right to liquidate and act like nothing happened, they should be held accountable.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

When a  parent corporation creates <strong>one or more</strong> subsidiary corporations.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong><br/>\nThe parent corporation identifies the need or opportunity to establish subsidiary corporations to achieve  specific business objectives. These objectives can include risk  mitigation, expanding into new markets, separating business divisions, or taking advantage of tax benefits.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Legal Structure:</strong><br/>\nThe parent corporation decides on the legal structure of the subsidiary corporations. Common structures  include limited liability companies (LLCs), corporations (Inc.), or  partnerships, depending on the nature of the business and its goals.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Name and Registration:</strong><br/>\nThe parent corporation selects <strong>a name for each subsidiary and ensures that the chosen names are not  already in use by other businesses.</strong> It then registers each subsidiary  with the appropriate government authorities, such as the Secretary of State&#39;s office in the United States.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Ownership and Capitalization:</strong><br/>\nThe parent corporation determines the ownership structure of each subsidiary and allocates the  initial capital or assets required for their operation. This often involves <strong>issuing shares of stock or ownership stakes to the parent  corporation</strong> or other investors.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Governance and Management:</strong><br/>\nThe subsidiary corporations may have their own boards of directors, officers, and management teams.  The parent corporation typically exercises control through its ownership and may appoint directors or executives to oversee the subsidiaries.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Operating Agreements or Bylaws:</strong><br/>\nSubsidiary corporations establish their own operating agreements (for LLCs) or bylaws (for  corporations) to define their internal governance, decision-making  processes, and other operational details.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Financial Independence:</strong><br/>\nIt&#39;s essential for subsidiary corporations to maintain their financial independence to prevent  commingling of assets and liabilities with the parent company. They often have separate bank accounts, financial records, and tax filings.  </p>\n\n<h1>What about Shorts or Shareholders?</h1>\n\n<p>When a company is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and proposes a plan that involves creating new subsidiary corporations (often referred  to as &quot;butterfly corporations&quot;), the treatment of existing shares can vary depending on the specifics of the bankruptcy plan and the approval of the bankruptcy court.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Conversion to New Equity:</strong><br/>\nSometimes, existing  shareholders may receive <strong>new shares in the reorganized parent company or its subsidiary corporations.</strong> This can occur if the bankruptcy plan  provides for a debt-for-equity swap, where a portion of the company&#39;s  debt is converted into equity, effectively giving existing shareholders  ownership in the reorganized entity.   </p>\n\n<p>When shares of a company are <strong>extinguished</strong>, it means they are effectively  canceled or rendered worthless, often as part of a corporate action or <strong>restructuring</strong>, such as in bankruptcy. The treatment of short positions  when shares get extinguished depends on several factors, including the  circumstances leading to the extinguishment and the specific terms of  the short position.<br/>\nIf the shares to cover a short position are not available due to extinguishment, and cash settlement is not feasible, the short seller  may face a forced buy-in by their brokerage or lender. This means the  lender could forcibly close the short position by purchasing shares in  the market, potentially at unfavorable prices.   </p>\n\n<h1>Process in a nutshell</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing: \u2714\ufe0f\ud83d\udc1b</strong><br/>\nThe company in financial distress files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize its finances and operations.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Bankruptcy Plan Development: \u2714\ufe0f \ud83d\udcda</strong><br/>\nDuring the bankruptcy process, the company develops a bankruptcy reorganization plan, which outlines how it intends to address its financial obligations, restructure its operations, and emerge from bankruptcy.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Creation of Butterfly Corporations: \u2714\ufe0f\ud83e\udd8b</strong><br/>\nAs part of the bankruptcy plan, the company may propose the creation of one or more new subsidiary corporations (butterfly corporations) to separate or reorganize certain assets, divisions, or liabilities. These subsidiary corporations may be formed to hold specific assets or operations of the bankrupt company.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Treatment of Existing Shares:  \ud83d\udd51\ud83e\udd6c</strong><br/>\nThe treatment of existing shares of the bankrupt company can vary depending on the terms of the bankruptcy plan.<br/>\nShort sellers who have open short positions must cover their positions. This can be challenging if the shares are canceled, as there may be no shares available to buy to cover the short position.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Emergence from Bankruptcy: \ud83d\udd51\ud83c\udfc3</strong><br/>\nIf the bankruptcy plan is approved and implemented, the company will <strong>emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a reorganized entity with a new ownership structure</strong>, possibly including the butterfly corporations.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>New Ownership Structure: \ud83d\udd51 \ud83c\udfc5</strong><br/>\nThe butterfly corporations may become subsidiaries of the reorganized company, and the ownership structure may include creditors, new investors, and, in some cases, existing shareholders or short sellers who were able to negotiate favorable terms.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\ud83e\udd17 </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Unfortunately I couldnt make it to the show this time, but maybe I can do it next week.<br/>\nSo I figured doing a TA here for the first time.<br/>\nIve seen some TA across the subs and I have to say that they are often kinda misleading. Especially with Bed bath &amp; Beyond.<br/>\nIt is important to note, that if people want to do good technical analysis, they have to know what they are talking about and how they use data or indicators. To do accurate TA and stuff it is necessary to sign up for a monthly subscription for real time data. The chart looks completely different and has no delay.<br/>\nThis stock trades OTC.   OTC means &quot;Over-The-Counter&quot; and is not bound to any regulation. NASDAQ, NYSE etc. have &quot;rules&quot; and the stock behaves according to the rules. So OTC and Exchanges are to be considered as two different things.<br/>\nOTC is considered more &quot;decentral&quot; and some or all positions dont need to be reported when bought.<br/>\nThe level of transparency in OTC trading can vary depending on the  market, the participants involved, and the regulatory requirements.  Unlike centralized exchanges where trades and order books are typically  publicly accessible, OTC trades often occur privately between parties.  This lack of public visibility can offer increased privacy and  flexibility to market participants but can also lead to challenges in  assessing market liquidity, price discovery, and overall market health.    </p>\n\n<p>So, since we know that now. How does this affect TA? Well, a lot. We can say something can happen and the next day we are surprised by something else. That is already difficult to do on normal exchanges, but it is even more difficult to do on OTC. And seeing people being so sure what happens and just move goal posts anytime it doesnt, shows how unprofessional they are.<br/>\nSadly, there are a lot of them on many platforms and just help to confuse the people that dont know TA. And I do often think that they are supported with artificial likes and bots to make sure of that.   </p>\n\n<h1>Finally to the TA</h1>\n\n<p>I&#39;m attempting here to do TA like I would normally do on centralized exchanges even though we know now what OTC is really like.<br/>\nWe have slipped out the major uptrending channel. It had its 3 peaks up there and indicated of a rejection. We moved into a downtrend for now where we could see 12cents until 12th September.<br/>\nIt is interesting to see how the chart moves towards an important date that we have for BBBY. 12Cents would mean test of support that has been untested since the violent move up from 4cents.<br/>\nIt could wick out the gap that has been created back then at around 10cents and we would be shooting back up on some &quot;news&quot;. There are also a lot of gaps to the upside that will need to be covered if everything turns positive.   </p>\n\n<h1>My Perspective on the stock &amp; the market</h1>\n\n<p>I do think there is something in the making to turn out positively else there wouldnt be such drama about it. My first buy in was pre bankruptcy at 80cents, and my next buys were at 10cents  &amp; 20cents.<br/>\nIf I wasnt ballsdeep already in GME &amp; DRSed. Id probably go all in on this one and expecting either to get rekt or enjoy the wealth. The same Ive done with Evergrande before suspension. And now its going to return back trading. To make a lot of money, means to risk a lot of it. I&#39;m very aware that I&#39;m in a risky play or plays. But I dont need the media or anyone else to tell me that. And if they wanna make me &quot;sell&quot; who is buying then?<br/>\nIm currently attempting to DRS all my BBBY because I just dont trust banks &amp; brokers. A broker didnt let me sell a stock during the sneeze in 2021 and made excuses of technical difficulties.<br/>\nFor me I dont need to be in a squeezeplay as my buy zone was pretty bottom. Teddyshares are already enough for me. And to make sure I will get these 100%, I decided to go full on DRS.   </p>\n\n<p>Owning shares in streetname is like being naked. You are only allowed to do with them what the broker allows you to. And I certainly dont need &quot;my money back&quot; from them, when things start to get intense.</p>\n\n<p><em>Charts are the news. The news you read online are already late. Stockmarket algorithms rule and trade on their own. People dont move stocks. Institutions do. Institutions own media, media writes lies &amp; excuses. If the algorithm wants to pump or dump a stock, the human will make sure to have a coverup story for that. When the algorithm decides to dump heavily, it means volume has been exhausted. Then it will use the money of people being liquidated in order to create a new high.</em><br/>\nBeing constantly harrassed by media for investing in bed bath beyond or gamestop, is them showing their true form. My company is bankrupt, I want to step in and help it survive. I dont want it dead, thats why I invest. Thats how I would want to invest in any other stock and to help innovation.<br/>\nA real economy is having a company that sells good products and people buy these products and the company gets real revenue, everyone pays taxes and GDP is healthy and the government build us stuff for everyday life.<br/>\nBut today its all about who to f#ck over first, who to steal from and to look very short term. The institutions just look how to enrich themselves and short every new stock down into oblivion, destroying companies. They are sawing the branch they are sitting on. We want innovation and we need innovation. But sadly I have a feeling we have been stuck for the past 10 years on consuming the same items over and over again with increased price tags. Forcing us to work all day long, have limited time for hobbies and no money to create great things while they are making our lives exactly like that so they could continue on stealing and lying.<br/>\nA healthy economy shouldnt be made of only apple or tesla (monopolies). It should be a wide spread basket of companies that provide work &amp; good pay for people. Greed is what destroys everything. We dont need to feel &quot;power&quot;, all we need is a healthy co-operation. Helping each other to achieve great things. And the institutions/banks/brokers should be really be ashamed of themselves what they have done to us.  </p>\n\n<p>Flairing as opinion, because that all and TA is just like my opinion, man.   </p>\n\n<p>- Lumi-Lightbringer </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/uLNahFqg3B5bpR9kcSwktJywxtZQgL7om3kPhV2r1w0.jpg\"/></div>"}]
