I am already missing to listen to the youtube record of this amazing show, cause i usually sleep during the live show.</p>\n\n<p>Today i had to smile so hard when U_Copy said we going rip tomorrow but no financial advice and its almost closing bell and... well we did.... +4% :)</p>\n\n<p>Roach has the best calming voice I heart for a long time. I will miss u guys.</p>\n\n<p>But please discuss some OTC strategies, cause i guess we have to rip there. \nMy experience with OTC is the lack of liquidity. This means even if the price rips there 10x you might not get your shares sold, because the order will not be full filed. I traded there in 2014 when i was much younger my first play. $GTAT GT Advanced. They went BK cause Apple Inc. did not bought sapphire screens for their Iphone 5 i guess xD... anyway i lost 5k cause i did not to manage to sell on the right time. The worst was, that they wiped us out and i even was to able to write this shit off (lost position) for tax savings \ud83d\ude05</p>\n\n<p>So please discuss experience and maybe even the time frame of chapter 11 ( which could take at least half a year) until we might get canceled. That happened to my GTAT Shares... i rode them to hell :)</p>\n\n<p>Best regards Christage from Germany</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
