They&#39;ve been handing out FHA loans like candy at a parade, except the candy&#39;s bad and the parade&#39;s for properties making bank as rentals.</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;ve been fudging numbers on the down-low.

For those unfamiliar, Merrill had a heavy hand in the crisis due to their subprime mortgage exposure, risky securities (like CDOs), and high leverage. When the housing bubble burst, firms like Merrill faced massive losses, leading to Bank of America acquiring them.</p>\n\n<p>Now, here&#39;s where it gets interesting: Scott Swift, once a VP at Merrill Lynch, currently runs the Swift Group under Bank of America&#39;s Merrill re-brand.
