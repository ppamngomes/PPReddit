It happens when short sellers, who have borrowed shares and sold them in the hopes of buying them back at a lower price, are forced to cover their positions by buying shares at a higher price due to an unexpected rise in the stock&#39;s price.</p>\n\n<p>The issuance of additional shares by Cede &amp; Co. alone would not directly cause a short squeeze. Short squeezes are primarily driven by changes in supply and demand dynamics and can be triggered by various factors, such as positive news, strong buying pressure, or a sudden shift in market sentiment.</p>\n\n<p>However, if the issuance of additional shares by Cede &amp; Co. were to significantly impact the overall supply of shares available for trading, it could potentially have an indirect effect on short squeezes. If the increase in shares outstanding were to reduce the availability of shares for short sellers to borrow or increase the number of shares they need to cover their positions, it could potentially contribute to a short squeeze if other market factors align.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s important to note that the occurrence of a short squeeze depends on various complex factors, including the specific dynamics of supply, demand, market sentiment, and the actions of market participants. It cannot be solely attributed to the issuance of additional shares by one entity.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
