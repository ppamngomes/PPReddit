And the company went into ch11 bankruptcy, which is really good, and the stock price dropped from $25to $0.1, which means me and my online friends can buy so many stocks. Yes I am down 50%, but that is a good thing, it will go to $1000+. This is because the price is fake because they are illegally shorting it.
