Because that\u2019s my main reading time. When I peepee is when I pp. </p>\n\n<p>Whatever your fancy is- I really appreciate that so many of y\u2019all take the time to write the revelations you have about this play, whether big or small, especially now. Shills, haters, and impatient pps might say, \u201cEnough with the shit posts and black tar pre smoked tin foil!\u201d But I say, \u201cNay! Bring it on Brethren Apes!\u201d We (or at least I) still need the encouragement, the hype, the hopium and copium, and most of all, to know that there is still a real community around this insane play, people just like me who aren\u2019t crazy, who are intelligent <em>meh</em> (I might eat crayons but at least I go for that good good Crayola), who have the cojones to take a risk to change our lives, and the hearts to genuinely want the system of financial injustice to change. Whether hero or zero, we did it, something that most people never do in their lives- take an actual risk to bring about actual change. My proverbial hat is off to you, mighty people, dreamers of dreams, music makers, world shakers. Don\u2019t let them get you down! Damn the Man, and Eat the Rich! </p>\n\n<p>I just want to say thank you. Thanks for keeping the posts coming, and keeping my spirits up. </p>\n\n<p>Now onto the little nip stroke I promised: As I was having my pp time \ud83d\udebd , I thought to myself, that if this play is truly over, liability is essentially gone right? I think one reason we see our bud Pulte getting more brazen recently is because of this. Go ahead and try to take the man to court for influencing a stock that is worthless, cannot be traded, has disappeared into thin air. Right? I mean if it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done. \nIn this past year many an ape has come on the sub to say, \u201cIf RC isn\u2019t in this play, he could just say so. He could just put out a little tweet tweet, like the noble Larry Cheng did (and others) to clearly state they have nothing to do with BBBY,\u201d citing this as hardcore proof the guy was still with us. I always saw this particular argument as a pacifier for struggling apes, understanding that hey- we all need something to suck on from time to time to help us feel better; hell that\u2019s why we have PP! But in reality, if I was in the middle of a super expensive lawsuit for pumping and dumping I would err on the side of just not saying anything at all. To me it always made most sense for RC to not say anything either way. </p>\n\n<p>\u2026until now\u2026</p>\n\n<p>What about now huh? It\u2019s over now, right? Shills please step up to the mic to give us your full list of all the evidence that this play has been over for weeks! So if it\u2019s over, I believe that gives more leeway for RC to speak up and signal that he wasn\u2019t a part of it. I believe in RC. Yeah he\u2019s a businessman who does what he does for the money. No shit. That\u2019s what makes him great- no pretense that he\u2019s not about the paper. But for me there is a mountain of evidence that he\u2019s also a person of character and value, someone who sees the value of the customer. And because of that, I\u2019m happy waiting to hear from the man one way or another. If the play is truly over, there should be less and less liability to talk about Bobby. And if that\u2019s the case, it makes sense that at some point RC would likely let his followers know that he was out last fall and was never back in. When I hear it from the horse\u2019s mouth, I\u2019ll think about cashing in my invisible chips for a tax loss. Until then, the space suit stays on. </p>\n\n<p>Peace, provision, and much love to all of you today, fellow degens. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Thanks for being apeshit apes. Never change and keep it coming. You light up my life. You give me hope to carry on. \nBut also- RC might not have been able to deny involvement before, but if shares are truly worthless, if it\u2019s all over as the little shilly-beans like to say, he most certainly could now. And yet\u2026.he doesn\u2019t. Maybe something, maybe nothing, but it keeps my tits on point.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Just like no one can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that this entire time they have known FOR SURE what was going to happen. Nobody has and nobody does except the parties actually involved (shout out to my girls Sue and Holly!). Most of us have been hodling out of sheer confusion, great hope, and a diligent following of the brilliant DD put out by people on here who really know their stuff. </p>\n\n<p>So why would I give up now that I\u2019m in the exact same position I have been this whole time? I didn\u2019t know what would happen then, and I don\u2019t know what will happen now. That\u2019s the truth of it.

What are we waiting for again? How is this going to make money?</p>\n\n<p>Based on what I&#39;ve read on the subs, BBBY will never exist again, right? Like, if Bed Bath is bought out, that ticker won&#39;t come back, but instead a new one will be issued for whatever the new company is, right? And if Bed Bath does a turn around, again, BBBY will cease to exist, BBBYQ shares will be worthless and a new ticker will be issued. Is all of that right so far?</p>\n\n<p>If so, then, just to be clear, is what we are all waiting on that hopefully a magnanimous buyer will buy the company and give us OG shareholders a piece of the pie based on what they can afford? And that&#39;s how we&#39;ll make money?</p>\n\n<p>And/or we are waiting for a squeeze because we&#39;ve been so severely shorted? But, this is where I am really confused: When exactly will shorts have to actually cover their positions? Obviously if there was really a bk or we went to zero, they never have to cover/close, but holding the belief that that will not happen- when? When will they have to cover? And why would this create a squeeze? Why would there be FOMO that would make our stock increase? Like if Monday comes and RC or China or Pulte or whoever makes a bid, and it&#39;s amazing, and people lose their minds and want in- well, why would they buy BBBYQ if that ticker is just going to be obsolete? Wouldn&#39;t they just wait to buy whatever the new ticker will be? And if they don&#39;t buy BBBYQ- how will there be a pump that would force shorts to close or gamma ramps or any of those potential squeezes?</p>\n\n<p>I really want shorts to be fucked, but maybe I&#39;ve just consumed too much info and got it all mixed up, but I am officially not understand how exactly they will be fucked if our ticker will be discontinued and obsolete even if they best news we&#39;re all hoping for comes to fruition.</p>\n\n<p>Wrinkles- PLEASE HELP!</p>\n\n<p>p.s.
