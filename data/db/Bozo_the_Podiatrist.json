The company has proactively minimized exposure to cryptocurrency risk throughout the year and does not currently hold a material balance of any token.

However, in light of the bed bath Ch. 11 saga, that statement begins to make far more sense.  </p>\n\n<p>I see forward looking legalese all over that statement.
