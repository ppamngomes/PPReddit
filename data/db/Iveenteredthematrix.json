They did not want to transfer my shares to AST. The first person said, I would have to talk to AST and make an account with them first, before they could do anything. I told them that that\u2019s not true and it could be done on their end. She said she would transfer me to someone else that may be able to help. After being put on hold multiple times, rep. 2 said that unfortunately, they are not allowing transfers due to bbby bankruptcy.</p>\n\n<p>What I found interesting is that he stated \u201cyou might be able to trade bbby eventually when it\u2019s back on the market or if there is some type of payout, then you might be able to transfer out\u201d I never mentioned anything about being aware of any type of payout for my shares. So for someone who acted like he was oblivious of anything with bbby, I found it interesting that he knew about rumored payout. </p>\n\n<p>I knew he was lying, so I  asked to speak to the brokerage compliance department. Rep 2 said ok\u2026but he did not transfer me to a brokerage compliance department. They transferred me to another representative. </p>\n\n<p>Rep 3 said he might be able to transfer my shares but there\u2019s no assurance. So, I told him to initiate the transfer and to transfer me to the brokerage compliance department once it was done. He asked me \u201cwhy do you need to speak to them\u201d I told him it was none of his business. So he insisted on wanting to know, so I said ,I need assurance that my transfer is initiated and I need assurance from someone that isn\u2019t lying to me. I Told him I didn\u2019t appreciate being lied to. He said that being able to transfer bbby shares is just something that they became aware of in the last hour and that\u2019s the reason the first two reps and himself weren\u2019t  sure.   </p>\n\n<p>I was transferred to yet another representative, who said he had more clearance. Once they saw I was not budging and wanting to speak to the compliance department they decided to change the way they were speaking to me. </p>\n\n<p>The new rep( rep 4) initiated my transfer and gave me a reference number. He said he would call me back in a couple days to update me on the status of my request. Rep 3 remained on the line. Once rep 4 was done, he said he would let me speak to the rep 3 about transferring me to the compliance department.</p>\n\n<p>So, what he ended up saying is that they don\u2019t have a brokerage compliance department and that he\u2019s the manager of that branch but he could \u201cwrite a note\u201d \nand pass the message on. I said if you don\u2019t have a CD then who are you passing the message on to? He said well they have a department but they don\u2019t do \u201cface calls\u201d? With clients. </p>\n\n<p>He said he was sorry and that he wasn\u2019t trying to give me the loop around. He said my transfer was initiated and he does strive to help all Charles Schwabs customers. He said they would give me call on the status soon, so I left it at that.</p>\n\n<p>I had told them I only wanted 80 percent of my shares transferred but after they did that,  I asked for 100% of them transferred. Why? Because if my shares were worth nothing, then there would be no reason for them to want to keep them.</p>\n\n<p>Just thought I\u2019d share in case anyone else goes through the same thing\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are all butterflies living in cocoons and maybe death will free us\u201d -me</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "TRUST ME BRO", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ea0027"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
