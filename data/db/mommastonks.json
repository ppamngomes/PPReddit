This is not financial advice, merely my own personal opinion).</p>\n\n<p>So. Question one:</p>\n\n<h1>Will the $10 billion pay everyone off, including us?</h1>\n\n<p>Yes, it is enough to, But NO, it very likely <em>won\u2019t</em> be used for that (at least not in full).</p>\n\n<p>As we know, when exiting bankruptcy with NOLs intact (&gt;50% of new company keeps old shareholders AND qualified creditors), any remaining claims <em>do</em> need to be somehow settled up. More on that below, but at a minimum other claimants need to be settled up before we get paid. Additionally, the company as a going concern (also needed for NOLs) is worth a lot more to us AND everyone else involved in the bankruptcy if they don\u2019t pay off anyone they don\u2019t need to.</p>\n\n<h1>So how much of that money <em>do</em> we get paid?</h1>\n\n<p>Unknown, but could range from $0 to much higher.</p>\n\n<p>Why is zero a possibility? To get the NOLs, the business needs to remaining intact. Anything in that bucket that doesn\u2019t go to paying us will set up the ongoing concern for additional success (ie I wouldn\u2019t expect to see the <em>entire</em> $10b split across the share count)</p>\n\n<h1>So if they keep it all, is the company just worth zero still because they have all assets offset?</h1>\n\n<p>The fun thing about money in business is that $10b injected into a company <em>doesn\u2019t</em> make the company worth $10b. It also doesn\u2019t keep it worth $0, unless you\u2019re only measuring by actual dollars. $10 billion cash in hand with $10 in debt is worth quite a bit more than $0 (even if it fully balances out), and is also worth more than $10 billion. You can see this in action when money is injected to buy equity in companies (in the valuation multipliers on any operating company, but especially on venture capital\u2014the value in most companies is in the expectation of to capturing <em>future</em> revenue, not just current). For a fully operating business, you can get a more consistent valuation based on the business\u2019s income over the last year of revenue, + what the market you operate in is expected to do (these are those industry estimates you see on earnings).</p>\n\n<p>As examples, Amazon has a price to earnings ratio of ~94, which is <em>really</em> high (as the expectation is that it will continue to expand in current and future markets).</p>\n\n<p>Best Buy, as a <em>better</em> example of normal, has a price to earnings ratio of ~10.</p>\n\n<p>But what if it\u2019s not fully operating, and value is only in operating potential, not in actual earnings? This is where we\u2019d be looking at a discounted cash flow analysis, which is how many startups are valued when injecting in cash many multiples greater than actual current revenue.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>our</em> case though, Butterfly\u2019s potential valuation is trickier than either of these. We have actual stores that have operated within the last year, someone\u2019s injected 10b in assets in, PLUS the NOLs, plus the existing vendor relationships/warehouses/stores, plus the backing (presumably) of very knowledgeable leadership. Plus none of the naturally accumulated bad business commitments that grow slowly over time in any business, but usually create drag because carving them out would be an enormous effort while the business is operating. Scaling is less of a problem, because the backbone is all there, and operational inefficiencies have been carved out at scale through the Chapter 11 process.</p>\n\n<h1>How much value does that actually net out to for us?</h1>\n\n<p>No one knows yet, but it should be considerable, and that\u2019s ignoring those of you who only came to the party for the potential short squeeze. We don\u2019t know what the equity split will be with us as shareholders, AND we don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to sell off/split the businesses apart. As long as they allow shareholders and qualified creditors (qualified defined as they\u2019ve held the debts for more than 3 years, OR the debts rose in the normal course of business) to keep at least 50% of the equity during reorg, they keep however many NOLs have been racked up, and the actual worth (and what payout shareholders might get for a spinoff, via redoing the plan to make this happen) is, as in any Chapter 11 with a potential going concern, a giant question mark.</p>\n\n<h1>So why is everyone so excited?</h1>\n\n<p>Even forgetting the NOLs as a source of value that incentivizes someone to both take advantage of them, as that\u2019s really what requires preserving value for retail, there\u2019s something a LOT more concrete.</p>\n\n<p>One of those pre-bankruptcy creditors, Hudson Bay, opted for <em>common stock</em> ownership (ie: one of us) after bankruptcy had been initiated. </p>\n\n<p>They OPTED INTO dropping their priority in the creditor claims, AND already agreed on what price point they bought their equity at. If there were numerous other qualified creditors expected to dilute it further, this makes no sense, even if you took into consideration the going concern and NOLs.</p>\n\n<p>However <em>improbable</em>, the <em>simplest</em> reason for doing this would be that <em>if</em> there isn\u2019t any (or much) additional dilution expected, that is the path that would make the most sense for them to take.</p>\n\n<h1>A more rare question: \u201cBut how do we know this $10 billion is a good thing for us? It\u2019s showing up as a debt, how do we know they weren\u2019t forced into something after the IP sales didn\u2019t raise enough\u201d</h1>\n\n<p>You can\u2019t force someone to accept money. This money gives whoever provided it priority claim, AND if only paid out, removes every other claimant from being paid out. Whichever stakeholders have been running this crazy weird show are the same ones who accepted it, and there was no reason to hold the assets back that they did unless someone wanted them. If it was an eleventh hour bid practically under duress, they wouldn\u2019t have needed to (or bothered to!) set up the whole show to need a buy out like that. If it didn\u2019t appear then you\u2019re on the hook for wasting more than half billion dollars of claimant owed money on things that weren\u2019t needed.</p>\n\n<h1>tl;dr</h1>\n\n<p>I\u2019m trusting the process. No one knows how much, or even when, but decisions post bankruptcy point to some very good things for how much/little dilution we can expect to see.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83d\udfe2 Big Momma \ud83d\udcc8 Stonks \ud83e\udd8b", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
