PPseeds lost (but really won) and now owes Bill a cheeseburger which they&#39;ll share over a livestream in the future. Personally, I really hope he wears his astronaut suit for the meeting. \nOn the call, Bill brought up two things on his own: Carl Icahn and a thought experiment about which 5 to 10 companies GME should look at for acquisitions that compliment their business model. It led to some very interesting initial discussions and planned future discussions for the PPshow. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, the 10Q dropped during the second half of the call after Bill left. The wrinkles were dissecting it live, which was awesome to listen to. On the call either Jake or our resident accountant stripper found that <em>Acquisitions</em> was mentioned 98 times in the most recent 10Q. This language is new, and was not included in the previous five or so 10Qs. Initial consensus was that it looked bullish AF. Not necessarily directly related to BBBYQ but it very well could be.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there were 1,500 people on the spaces call which is enormous. Haven&#39;t seen that many on a spaces call yet. It&#39;s all bullish IMHO, remember RC is the executive chairman of GameStop (combination of CEO and Chairman role) and he has the power of capital allocation and acquisitions for gamestop who has $1.2 billion in cash ready to be used as he sees fit. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure there will be more info coming out in the near future but just wanted to update those not able to catch the space calls. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: \nPP owes Bill Pulte a cheeseburger. Bill mentioned Carl Ichan and seeded a thought experiment on which 5 to 10 companies GME could acquire. 10Q of GME dropped on the call, was dissected live and acquisition was mentioned 98 times in it, which is not normal. Also 1500 people tuned into the spaces call. </p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\ude80</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
