I have a lot of gme drs&#39;d. I don&#39;t really check reddit a lot because of my new job which leaves me mentally and physically drained everyday and imo the main sub is exceptionally boring and im happy to see people actually discussong things over here.I admit i am literally clueless about anything outside of gme but i want to learn. I have a few questions.  What is the ticker of interest in this sub? Is it bed bath and  beyond or buy buy baby? Does a squeeze on this side effect GME? Can someone give me a qick breakdown of what&#39;s happening over here or point me to a post that will get me up to speed? Thank you kindly!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Out of the loop. \ud83d\udca9 ", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#a06324"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
