Going off a recent post, where we counted the \u2018Tiks\u2019 on the infamous Teddy Doomsday clock - we zoomed in really far, even farther, and noticed there are blue \u2018tiks\u2019 as well. These are barely visible to the naked eye and blend in with the color of the clock. Add these up with the other \u2018tiks\u2019 between 10 and 12 and you get= 28. </p>\n\n<p>Just wanted to share..my wife actually discovered this but she\u2019s having difficulties creating a post in this sub which she doesn\u2019t understand; because she\u2019s the most harmless and zen person ever regarding this stock and can no longer wait for our success.
