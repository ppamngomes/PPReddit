I\u2019m starting to believe that he is just as corrupt and a bad actor as anyone else in the corrupt and greedy corporate world. He knew all in well what kinda twitter and Reddit following he had. He may of had a plan in the beginning but decided it wasn\u2019t gonna work. As far as we know Pulte is here trying to help save Cohens ass in the court case brought against him. Don\u2019t lay to much hope on Pulte. I\u2019m impressed with GameStops earnings and turnaround results, especially for a decaying brick and mortar trend but has shown to do nothing with BBBY. I wouldn\u2019t expect much before, during, or after the December 14th meetup. I believe it will just be another hype/nothing burger situation. This play has been nothing but a countuing lead on and nothing to really show for it besides a growing  community and great entertainment from the PP show. I believe PP and the guys believe in what the spill on the show, which in a sense can be more dangerous. You have a lot of inexperienced retail investors in this play with a lot of money. We\u2019re desperate and hungry. And I believe any glimmer of hope to retrieve something in return is what we\u2019re digging for. I\u2019ve accepted that nothing with come back and my investment is dead. This is starting to become mentally unstable for me and has put a dent in more important goals and events of my life. I respect the people that have come on the PP show and have given all they can to find the needle in the hay stack. As for me, I\u2019m checking out of this mess and going to explore new realms of making a living. If this is your first big loss or first time being an investor. Just know that this was very and clearly and unusual circumstance with high net worth individuals involved that have a reputation of doing bold moves in the markets and business world and or being a good individual (Pulte &amp; Cohen). Just be aware that the term Ponzi stems not from a made up definition but an individuals last name who did fool many good people into high hopes and good things to come. Good luck folks and I hope what ever is to end, ends well for all of us.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
