S\u00e4mtliche angeschlossenen B\u00f6rsen, \u00fcber welche das Wertpapier in EUR gelistet war (darunter die Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse, Stuttgarter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse und Gettex), haben den Handel vor dem Hintergrund der Insolvenz des Unternehmens ausgesetzt.</p>\n\n<p>Der Handel \u00fcber LYNX ist somit aktuell ausschlie\u00dflich in USD und MXN m\u00f6glich.</p>\n\n<p>Ein Transfer der Aktien ist jedoch nicht m\u00f6glich, da das Wertpapier in den USA als sogenannter Penny Stock am B\u00f6rsenplatz PINK gelistet ist.

All affiliated exchanges through which the security was listed in EUR (including the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Stuttgart Stock Exchange and Gettex) have suspended trading against the backdrop of the company&#39;s insolvency. </p>\n\n<p>Trading via LYNX is therefore currently only possible in USD and MXN. </p>\n\n<p>However, a transfer of the shares is not possible, as the security is listed in the USA as a so-called penny stock on the PINK stock exchange. These values, also known as U.S. micro cap stocks, are not transferable.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us by phone or e-mail. You can also find more helpful information online in our Help Center.</p>\n\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Last resort - transfering my shares to ibkr - is not possible - I am screwed. Also: If proof is needed, I could provide.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Please, people, be civil. I&#39;m in a bad place anyway, my shares seem to be locked. If you don&#39;t appreciate me asking for help because I fear my shares are locked, downvote this post. But I feel shitty enough without people telling me, what they think what kind of a stupid arse I am.\nThank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
