I was immediately connected with a cheerful agent (Rachael P) out of Westlake, TX. She asked 4 questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How is your day going?</li>\n<li>What securities are you wanting to move?</li>\n<li>How many shares do you want to move?</li>\n<li>Do you already have an account with AST</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The entire process took 5 minutes. </p>\n\n<p>Her follow-up regarding timeframe:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI show that the request on our side typically takes 4-7 business days.  After that, the timeframe will depend on how long it takes AST to post the shares.  Once done, they will send you a statement.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Had I known the process was so easy, I would have done it sooner. </p>\n\n<p>The website says there\u2019s a $50 fee to transfer your entire account, $25 for partial. However, she never mentioned any fees. </p>\n\n<p>There you go, I\u2019ve now officially joined the DRS club with 10,000 of my BBBYQ shares. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR - the process takes 5 minutes and it can all be done through the Live Chat.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I know what happens tax wise, if we moon, but what happens if things go the other way and shares get canceled and everything goes to zero?
