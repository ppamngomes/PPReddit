On this day, they spent roughly $3,120,000 on 130,000 puts. Not only is this a large sum of money, these aren&#39;t exactly &quot;safe&quot; options either, as they are ~40% out of the money. They expire in less than a year on 6/21/2024 (8 months). </p>\n\n<p>On both October 20th (Friday) and 23rd (yesterday, Monday) 2 weeks after the initial opening position, the contract was hit again. Friday for ~40,000 contracts bringing the total open interest to ~170,000, and Monday for another ~50,000. This will bring the total open interest to ~220,000 contracts.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, if this is the same entity, they have spent an estimated $6,000,000 on options contracts that have the potential to expire worthless. Sure, there are plenty of people out there that could lose 6m and not worry about it, but let&#39;s be realistic. Rich af or not, nobody wants to lose 6 million dollars. Does this trader know theres about to be major turmoil in the banking sector, starting with BAC? Disclaimer: I am currently short real estate, energy, tech, and finance via put leaps, and now that I have seen this, I will buy a few as well. Too enticing to pass up.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/a-o0eNse_54lV6Pjqngmm6uiHYR-gOHnzRw3khIyH0o.jpg\"/></div>"},

First picture: my fidelity port with no more bbbyq options (sigh of relief kinda, port isnt down 75% anymore lol). Blurred other tickers cuz not sure about rules. Second picture: what a cleared options trade that was purchased looks like. Third picture: what a cleared options trade that was sold looks like. Fourth picture: the bbbyq options i had, with a different note than usual (accelerated), while still processing. Very curious to see what its gunna look like once cleared. </p>\n\n<p>Also, I&#39;m clearly a paper handed bitch, those spy 2dte gains were paltry compared to if i had held overnight. I took a fooking day trade thinking i was smaaht, and the day after those contracts were worth 4.00 a piece. So no, its not a flex, 100 to 270 is shit when it could&#39;ve been 100 too 800.
