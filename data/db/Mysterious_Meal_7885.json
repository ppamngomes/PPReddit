Most average people don&#39;t know why they can&#39;t purchase from some brokers, don&#39;t know what OTC is, etc... I wish we have a summarized post that explains everything and just tells them to read one post for newcomers.</p>\n\n<p>I believe for Bigger MOASS we should help people understand what we are understanding in an easier way.</p>\n\n<p>Most people just say what is BBBY? Bed Bath and Beyond! oh, bankrupted company on huge sale!</p>\n\n<p>If someone organizes the stories of how we got here and it&#39;s going to the moon so newcomers can have some kind of summarized guideline for better understanding?</p>\n\n<p>Also, many people gave up on buying because they don&#39;t know how to buy them.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, I believe more people will help a bigger squeeze.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
