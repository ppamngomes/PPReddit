Thank you \ud83d\ude4f", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>That dude with the bullshit \u201cPP and company are not your friends\u201d post has Paperhand Pete shill vibes.  I don\u2019t know why these micro-dicks have to keep rage posting us.  Touch grass, bro! You want some smoke, we\u2019ll come for you little bitch.  I\u2019m so happy that the mod team decided to keep that posting up so we can jump his ass in the comments.  I mean, who doesn\u2019t use paragraphs to make it easier to read?  </p>\n\n<p>Motive:  Why you so interested in our investment?  Seems super sus!  You don\u2019t know us and you couldn\u2019t care a fuck about what we invest in. Nobody is buying it.  Not even CNBC when they do a (sponsored) \u201creport\u201d on bed bath and directly call it a \u201chit piece\u201d.  Whoops, they weren\u2019t supposed to say the quiet part out loud. </p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s pretend for a minute that you are so worried about retail investor, then why don\u2019t you talk about the real crime going on?  THE ILLEGAL NAKED SHORTING AND SYNTHETIC SHARES! The reason we are in this position at sub $1 is because your associates are shorting a security that they don\u2019t even own.  You are borrowing shares or creating synthetic shares to bankrupt this company, so you don\u2019t have to close your short positions.  No cell, no sell - people should go to jail for these crimes, since they wouldn\u2019t just let the brand sell in February.  Had to push it into BK, cause it always worked before.  But now there are a lot more eyes on this play than you could have ever expected. \ud83d\udc40 </p>\n\n<p>This BK protection was the best thing to happen to BBQ because we now have the naked short selling of synthetic shares exposed in court.  I wonder why the judge on day 1 asked for a list of investors with 4.5% or higher.  How many multiples is this stock shorted?  What crimes have you guys been up to?  </p>\n\n<p>All the MSM FUD is amazing for the algo to process and keep it cheap so we can all gain a large concentration of shares.  Besides, whoever is being represented by Sixth Street Partners can use the debt as capital and will most likely own the company.  I might have been worried a bit, because I don\u2019t trust that the bad actors could get control of the company and shut it down but you wouldn\u2019t be here with your rage paragraph, because the company paying you to shill would already control this process.  The new owners don\u2019t even need the auction because we were able to sell a massive amount of inventory, make some money off the IP, shed unprofitable leases, free ourselves from the predatory debtors and swapped it out for friendly activist investors that will emerge from the BK ashes like a phoenix rising.  You will never forget this bear trap \ud83d\udc3b \ud83e\udea4 </p>\n\n<p>Why?  Because you can profit off the stumble of an American company.  The greed in this play by the market makers and hedge funds is incredible. How are the investment companies all making huge profits when the markets have been down for 18 months?  It\u2019s reported that $115 billion has been made off shorting this company, compared to our $200 million in retail investors to counter your illegal activities and buy it up on the cheap.  Thanks for that, and now we have you right where we want you.  \ud83c\udfaf </p>\n\n<p>You need to look at this from another perspective, we are not trapped in this play with you, as much as you are trapped in here with us.  If you watch the show, you wouldn\u2019t want to be trapped in here with us degens. We have nothing to lose, because your unstoppable greed took our profits. </p>\n\n<p>This show is the glue that binds us.  Entertaining and you might just learn a little about what is really going on behind the curtain.  Thank you PP and Co for providing a platform for retail investors to hear directly from the DD sources.  It provides the authenticity we need to sus out the bad actors.  BTW the securities crime investigator (OKbet) you had on Friday was outstanding!  Please more of this!  (but maybe put the drunk guy backstage so he isn\u2019t interrupting a contributor with valuable information).  Wrinkle my brain \ud83e\udde0</p>\n\n<p>Hey shill \ud83d\udc4bthe one thing that you didn\u2019t plan for with your algo is that risk adverse people would flood into this play and you would have to keep propping it up.  If you are so fucking worried about our investment, why don\u2019t you get them to turn off the algorithm that is suppressing the stock?  Let\u2019s see the real price of Teddy in an \u201copen market\u201d where the casino isn\u2019t cheating.  \ud83d\udcb8 </p>\n\n<p>Icahn wait for these Cohen-cidences to turn into fireworks.  We will find out who is going to win on this play real soon and by your fear, I can tell it has you shook to your crumbling foundation.  You\u2019re rage didn\u2019t make one person sell their shares, but what it did do is make a lot of people realize that we are getting closer.  \ud83e\uddf8\ud83d\ude80</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
