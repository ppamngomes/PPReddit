A company generates net  operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) if the operating expenses it has incurred exceed the revenues it has  earned during a single tax year. A company may apply or \u201ccarry forward\u201d NOLs to reduce future  tax payments (subject to certain conditions discussed below).4  See IRC \u00a7 172. 9. As discussed below, a company\u2019s tax attributes can become subject to significant  limitation under IRC \u00a7\u00a7 382 and 383 if an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs. The purpose of the relief  requested herein is to minimize the risk that an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs before the conclusion  of these restructuring cases. In doing so, the Debtors intend to maximize the value of their estates  by limiting tax liabilities generated during or as a result of the actions taken during the cases.  10. The Debtors currently estimate that, as of February 25, 2023, they had  approximately $1.6 billion of federal NOLs and $5 million of federal tax credits </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Tax Attributes are  potentially of significant value to the Debtors and their estates because the Debtors may be able to utilize the Tax Attributes to offset any taxable income generated by transactions consummated  during these Chapter 11 Cases (including with respect to any taxable disposition of some or all of  the Debtors\u2019 assets). Additionally, depending on the structure utilized in a chapter 11 plan, in the  event any of the Debtors\u2019 Tax Attributes were to survive, the Debtors may be able to carry forward  certain of those Tax Attributes to offset federal taxable income or federal tax liability in future  years. Accordingly, the relief requested herein will preserve the value of the Tax Attributes to the  benefit of all of the Debtors\u2019 stakeholders. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>***Now there are other requirements that need to be followed in order to ensure the use of the full amount. My assumption is that if they are filing the above to prevent a loss to the tax credit then they are planning on following the other requirements (below) in order to be able to use the full value.***</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Section 382 typically limits the use of NOLs by the acquiring corporation where there is a 50% ownership change. However, this is not necessarily the case in bankruptcy situations. </p>\n\n<p>As long as the corporation was under jurisdiction in a title 11 or similar case and the former shareholders and creditors remain in \u201ccontrol\u201d after the bankruptcy, then the limitations of Sec. 382 do not apply. </p>\n\n<p>Special rules apply in bankruptcy and similar cases limiting the use of these assets but <strong>IRC Section 382(l)(5) provides an exception to the general rule if the following conditions are met:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Immediately before the ownership change, the loss corporation is under the jurisdiction of the court in a title 11 or similar case; and</li>\n<li>The corporation\u2019s shareholders and \u201cqualified creditors\u201d (determined immediately before the ownership change) own at least 50% of the stock\u2019s value and voting power immediately following the ownership change.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The second bullet point is my focus in this post. If they want to use the full amount they have to ensure that previous shareholders and qualified creditors own at least 50 percent of the stocks value  following the ownership change. </p>\n\n<p>TL/DR:</p>\n\n<p>I believe, based on the filings, that stock holders shouldn&#39;t be worrying about being wiped out because it looks like BBBY wants to keep and use this valuable asset therefor current shareholders are required to be represented and made whole.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
