I think she\u2019s still underrated in a way to a lot of people like me who really don\u2019t listen to her music at all. She\u2019s statistically as big now as Michael Jackson was back in the day, arguably more so. I think the subtleties of Pulte possibly referring to her with the incessant only the young tweets, along with GMEs obvious expansion into NFTs, along with the most obvious use case for NFTs being ticket sales or virtual concerts gives at least a silhouette of tinfoil that she\u2019s going to change the game doing ticketing through GME somehow. Don\u2019t forget, she broke all redundancies of the ticket infrastructure in America when she announced tour. Sounds like a monopolistic industry ripe for disruption.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/3llvj131a94b1.jpg\"/></div>"}]
