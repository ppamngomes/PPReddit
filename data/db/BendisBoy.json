I believe the white pages that were recently brought up on the ppshow titled &quot;Debt is The New Private Equity&quot; and had to do about unlocking value through chapter 11 were a Kirkland and Ellis 2011 doc. It was fairly titjacking as it pretty much outlined the process that we were speculating would bring BABY to term. Thats when KJ said something about how it would be relevant if we saw Kirkland and Ellis in this BK proceeding. Something like 24 hours later im seening multiple docs with Kirkland and Ellis drop in relation to BBBY BK. Another confirmation of our theory that cohen and company will be using this BK to unlock value for everyone or am i genuinely regarded(very possible)?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
