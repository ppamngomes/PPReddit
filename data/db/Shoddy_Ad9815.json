Is she leading us on or is she deliberately sending a more optimistic signal? If she&#39;s looking for plausible deniability for bk then she&#39;s putting on the wrong personality for it. A leader should make an effort to be positive but at this stage it must be considered misleading shareholders.  </p>\n\n<p>2) Why would 2 proxy voting firms either walk away or be dismissed? If they did walk what moral issue would they have with an RS vote in particular which Roach uses as a basis for his latest outlook(which he doesn&#39;t clarify)? It&#39;s not their job to concern themselves if bbby wants to dilute after the vote so really I don&#39;t buy that they had an issue with the vote and walked as their concern is getting paid. The fact we ended up with the same proxy firm that Icahn(?) uses seems deliberate like it was more of a trust thing and they were being selective.   </p>\n\n<p>3) What amendments could we expect on the RS voting material that would dramatically change the stock&#39;s outlook? They cannot change the material we vote on i.e swap out RS with a merger at the last moment like some hope and they can only add amendments until the April 25th I believe, so I assume it would be something more advisory or related to a future outlook?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "", "text_color": "", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
