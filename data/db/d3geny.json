I&#39;ve been practicing M&amp;A for 2 years now, but before I did capital markets work (i.e., IPO/financings) and M&amp;A together, but now I have specialized to just M&amp;A. Not legal advice; I am not your lawyer. You can search up my history and see that I started working in Canada and moved to the US. That has no bearing with my qualifications as it is common in Big Law to hire in other jurisdictions. No I will not be sharing my identity - I&#39;ll just present objective facts.   </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m what you call a shill (as I know it, anyone that goes against to the moon is a shill). Why do I post? Because its entertaining to watch the pure denial and the incorrect analyses.

In Hertz and AA, prior to <strong>confirmation</strong>, their amended plan provided that a <strong>restructuring</strong> deal whereby <strong>new shares</strong> would be issued. BBBY&#39;s plan, which was confirmed, provided for <strong>liquidation</strong>, where all shares are cancelled <strong>without any new equity issuances</strong>. Comparing to Hertz and AA is comparing apples and oranges. Chapter 11 reorganization is extremely flexible, and is essentially a means to come to a deal with the creditors. You can&#39;t just compare certain aspects of a deal with another. </li>\n<li>&quot;<em>deletion vs. cancellation</em>&quot; - deletion is not legalese. That is simply not language we use in the context of shares. You can look up any purchase agreement, merger agreement, or asset purchase agreement. You won&#39;t find that language. The confusion is conflating two different things. Deletion is used in reference of the ticket as per FINRA. Cancellation means the shares are actually cancelled. Cancellation, as noted above, can be in conjunction for anything - (1) shares issued incorrectly, (2) two 100 share certificates are cancelled and a single 200 share share certificate is issued, (3) a share is repurchased into treasury, (4) a share is exchange, or (5) or a share is just cancelled without any further action. Again it has to be in context.</li>\n<li>&quot;<em>Look at Rule 12g-4(b)&quot; it talks about deregistration from a merger</em> - read further; it says if an ex-issuer is filing the form to not further comply with the SEC obligations via deregistering as a result of a merger/acquisition, then the <strong>successor entity</strong> must file the form. As noted above, Butterfly is literally just BBBY entities <strong>renamed</strong>. Under your theory, Teddy or whoever you&#39;re hoping to issue shares ought to have filed the form.</li>\n<li><strong>TBD - add anymore; happy to provide objective factual counterpoints.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>For the people calling the naysays &quot;shills&quot;</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKj8PlIiZVA\"><strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKj8PlIiZVA</strong></a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Technical ANALysis", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#9e8d49"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
