Hopefully there\u2019s a good home here. </p>\n\n<p>So many posts tonight but I just wanted to share some thoughts I had regarding BBBY the last few days. To borrow a phrase from Hal Roach I believe firmly that we have already won.\nI\u2019m no financial expert and I\u2019m absolutely smooth brained. But this just makes complete sense even I can connect some stupid dots.</p>\n\n<p>Dilution occurred. It is now being shown in several locations. That\u2019s ok. That was the offering that was sold. To who? I believe Icahn. Newell filed an 8k that shows they took a loan to acquire a company almost identical to the amount that Bed Bath stated they sold for.</p>\n\n<p>Reverse split will happen. We were diluted by 4x. if that one entity purchased in its entirety they now have voting power on their own to make the reverse split happen. They don\u2019t need you or I but I would still recommend voting if you can.</p>\n\n<p>Icahn is interested in the shipping capabilities of BBBY infrastructure. Guess what they will own when they buy and can possibly sell to Cohen? That\u2019s right! BUY BUY BABY.\nAll in all I call this a win. I am not as heavily invested as others but I am more invested than Pete the Pilot/Shill (love you dude) and to be frank we all have lots of money on the line and I can\u2019t wait for this to come to fruition. I\u2019m sure there  are some holes to be poked on specifics.</p>\n\n<p>I could post the links to all of this butttt. Just scroll down in the BBBY sub and you will see it all.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: because I can\u2019t spell.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
