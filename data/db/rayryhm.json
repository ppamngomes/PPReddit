Then came a huge dildo of $10b appearing on the creditor side.\nThere\u2019s no way Bobby will have that much debt and we won\u2019t know about it.\nThere\u2019s no way someone will owe you 10b dollars and you will wait like for ever to make appearance.\nHell if someone owes me $100 dollars and they are bankrupt I will be the first in court.\nUndertaker rose from the dead, this is the sign! Lube up and wait for the Boom \ud83d\udca5 \n$3000.69 dollar a share is not a meme.\nBig thanks to all the big DD writers. All of my close friends that I told to buy Bobby told me it\u2019s over, I told them it\u2019s not, some looked me like I\u2019m crazy.\nI told them, I know what you\u2019re thinking but I\u2019m just regarded and the gain porn is coming!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Unwavering erection ! \nRemember your shares belong to you, you paid for it and they don\u2019t belong to Bobby, if they are being removed without your consent their must be a replacement plan or some other plan!\nHere is my daily task, I login to Reddit like 10 times a day, then I see numbers like $18 a share, $25, then $460.69 then $1000 and/or $25 plus equity, all I do is bring out my calculator and estimate my future money then adjust my plan in my head based on the figure I get. I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m not alone!
