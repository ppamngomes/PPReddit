With the timing of the latest - and in my opinion likely the final - \u201aonly the young\u2019 tweet, I believe this could be it:</p>\n\n<p>Until today I was counting 16 tweets of Pulte saying the quote \u2018only the young\u2019. If you count the tweet from 10/4/24 saying it 3 times it sums up to 18 times in total. The lyrics of Only the Young by Taylor Swift (see below) uses the phrase exactly 19 times (background not counted).</p>\n\n<h2>So 1 more tweet to go until the music stops?</h2>\n\n<h2>\u2014&gt; This happened just now:</h2>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bcnc1x0yiwcb1.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38a40887aefbf02998ff0d5a76b2c9dc023ff8eb\">https://preview.redd.it/bcnc1x0yiwcb1.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38a40887aefbf02998ff0d5a76b2c9dc023ff8eb</a></p>\n\n<p>Is someone just \u201asinging along\u2018 his favorite song, until the music stops? A countdown?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Back to the beginning:</strong> The first \u2018only the young\u2019 tweet was already on November 17th 2021 ?! The first time he asked publicly about GME was 04/09/22 so after his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pulte/status/1512776675523796999?s=46&amp;t=pNszhew5lu_5agzpIRCzYw\">first swift tweet</a>. (2 days later after he read enough DDs he bought GME. Quick stud! I am reading for over 2 years on a daily basis and feel like still lacking behind). So he already knew more at that time and pretended not to know anything? Or he meant sth. else unrelated back then with his first \u2018only the one\u2019 tweet and picked it up later for this purpose (could be important for all bullshit lawsuits coming up).</p>\n\n<p>In two Tweets he replied to old RC tweets going way back in the past from 03/28/22 and 03/31/22. So why pick two 8 month old tweets to reply to? Maybe for the date 28th-31st of March 2023 something important was planed? So what happened at that time exactly one year later?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gwyipt70jwcb1.png?width=1067&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea6d84df090647f3fb7835905de84119f93bf6d3\">https://preview.redd.it/gwyipt70jwcb1.png?width=1067&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea6d84df090647f3fb7835905de84119f93bf6d3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/limx0w70jwcb1.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1287ee0654d6860f1c731f22f4885d270b77dcd6\">https://preview.redd.it/limx0w70jwcb1.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1287ee0654d6860f1c731f22f4885d270b77dcd6</a></p>\n\n<p>On 03/21/23 he added \u2018soon. But not too soon. \ud83d\ude80  $GME $PHM\u2019, to his only the young tweet. so something that is going to happened will happen but a little delayed?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eb868kg1jwcb1.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c836a26bc5392c61fa1607ee21c0732c7b08fb\">https://preview.redd.it/eb868kg1jwcb1.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c836a26bc5392c61fa1607ee21c0732c7b08fb</a></p>\n\n<p>On 03/28/23 (exactly one year after the RC cited tweets) he tweets \u2018we have special news forthcoming\u2019 3h later adding \u2018This will be delayed to another day\u2019 using a Taylor Swift meme citing another song of her \u2018Are you ready for it?\u2019</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jk8kbbi2jwcb1.png?width=1032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3989e2ce4e3899b38d241bf974afc658f0ff536\">https://preview.redd.it/jk8kbbi2jwcb1.png?width=1032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3989e2ce4e3899b38d241bf974afc658f0ff536</a></p>\n\n<p>So definitely a Swift fan? On 02/24/21 he already tweeted \u201cI\u2019m listening to Taylor Swift and giving away money\u201d and yes his favorite band is actually Taylor Swift as he tweeted himself! so yes seems like he is a big fan. Altogether he mentioned Swift many times before. Also, note that he once tweeted the extended lyrics with.. only the young. Can run\u2026. So while there were many theories, this is definitely about Taylor swift.</p>\n\n<p>I believe something was planned for the end of March, but balloons \ud83c\udf88 get shot down sometimes and plans get delayed.</p>\n\n<p>Did I also mention that one of Taylor Swifts songs is called \u2018bye bye baby\u2019 released on April 9th, 2021 exactly the date one year before Pulte tweets only the young three times for the first and only time?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tweets using \u2018only the young\u2019 overview</strong> (maybe off one day due to time zones):</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>11/17/21</li>\n<li>06/26/22</li>\n<li>09/04/22</li>\n<li>10/13/22</li>\n<li>10/28/22</li>\n<li>11/28/22 \u2014&gt; retweeted by himself \u2018remember this tweet, it will be important one day\u2019 \u2014&gt; liked by RC!</li>\n<li>11/30/22 can run</li>\n<li>12/01/22 \u2014&gt; replying to RC tweet from 03/28/22</li>\n<li>12/07/22</li>\n<li>01/11/23 \u2014&gt; replying to RC tweet from 03/31/22</li>\n<li>01/31/23</li>\n<li>03/17/23</li>\n<li>03/21/23 soon.
