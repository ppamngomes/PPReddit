RC is a short seller fighter as well as Byrne. Byrne is a Warren Buffet protege and refers to Mr. Buffet as his \u201crabbi\u201d. He made the decision to step down from overstock only after discussing the matter specifically with him. Byrne was the founder and ex ceo of the company, which he continues to consult and advise. We know if RC were to lay a hint to retail, embedded within a tweet, it would not be directly decipherable. A thumb war challenge to Buffet could very well be that. This whole process has been planned from the first day of court. RC will end up owning BBBY as a whole, pulling out of BK and operating as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d, instantly initiating a short squeeze which will essentially leave him paying nothing for his ownership in the company, BBBY and Baby. He actually knows how to turn a business around and make profit so this would obviously be the best case scenario for everyone involved, unfortunately BK was the only way to get it done due to JPMs lien interests and heavy market manipulation. We\u2019ve known for awhile RCs been involved in this play and is listed as a creditor in recent court filings. We now see the entrance of the same legal firm used to pen the cooperation agreement between Bed Bath and Beyond with RC Ventures early last year. We\u2019re almost there..</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
