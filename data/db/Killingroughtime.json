It has come to my attention that certain voices, shrouded by the anonymity of the internet, claim to speak for all of us (\u201cGME elites\u201d). You know who they are\u2014often appearing under different aliases, they peddle negativity and division, masquerading as concerned community members.</p>\n\n<p>Do not be deceived. These are not true representatives of our cause; they are the architects of fear, uncertainty, and doubt\u2014FUD, as it&#39;s commonly known. I, too, was once swayed by their theories of distraction, but I&#39;ve come to realize that they are the true distraction. Their aim is to splinter us, to sow discord among those fighting for the same goals.</p>\n\n<p>Let us not forget: we are all in this together no matter the ticker symbol. Don&#39;t allow a faceless stranger on social media, recycling the same tired arguments, to cast a shadow over our unity. It is time to rise above petty divisions, to remember why we&#39;re here, and to focus on what really matters.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
