Dream On Me isn\u2019t getting buy buy baby. While looking over the voting results, I noticed money was missing. Not pennies mind you, over 430 million dollars in bonds went poof. It wasn\u2019t until I saw Capt Jake\u2019s post about his hunt for  NOL Dick, that it hit me where the money went.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/16g283d/alixpartners_fee_statement_for_july_nols_still/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/16g283d/alixpartners_fee_statement_for_july_nols_still/</a></p>\n\n<p>In his post you can see CODI/NOL\u2026 What is CODI?</p>\n\n<p>Cancellation of debt income</p>\n\n<p>CODI generally: Cancellation of indebtedness is generally</p>\n\n<p>treated as taxable income to the debtor for U.S. federal</p>\n\n<p>income tax purposes. However, a number of exceptions</p>\n\n<p>and exclusions can potentially apply, as discussed further</p>\n\n<p>below.</p>\n\n<p>Triggering CODI: CODI can be triggered in a number of</p>\n\n<p>debt restructuring scenarios, including the following:</p>\n\n<p>\u2014 Equity-for-debt exchanges;</p>\n\n<p>\u2014 <strong>Asset-for-debt exchanges</strong>;</p>\n\n<p>\u2014 Debt-for-debt exchanges, including certain debt</p>\n\n<p>restructurings and modifications; and</p>\n\n<p>\u2014 Debt buybacks by a debtor or related party.</p>\n\n<p>We can rule out equity for debt, as we would lose that NOL dick. I can\u2019t see our mysterious creditor wanting to exchange debt. And BBBY is little too cash strapped to afford a buyback. So only one option remains, asset exchange. But what asset could our mysterious creditor want?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/o0a2ltvbmunb1.gif\">hmmm</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s right BABY!</p>\n\n<p>Dream On Me\u2019s  purchase agreement allows for someone better to swoop in and take it. Docket 1314 - Article 10:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    (h) by written notice of either Buyer or Sellers, if any Seller consummates one\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or more Alternative Transactions with one or more Persons other than Buyer. For the avoidance</p>\n\n<p>of doubt, Sellers entering into an Alternative Transaction shall not entitle Buyer to terminate this</p>\n\n<p>Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(h) unless and until such Alternative Transaction is</p>\n\n<p>consummated;</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to all our super sluts or sleuths depending on your preferred interpretation, we know Buy Buy Baby Global is a thing, a credit agreement from earlier this year with Sixth Street was enacted in Aug, BBBY made nearly a billion dollars in bankruptcy, they would not stop talking about NOL\u2019s and have added CODI\u2019s to their list. They say we\u2019re getting liquidated in chapter 11 because it\u2019s cheaper. I contend that this liquidation is a hoax. Why else would you fist your much needed buyers? Sure, some people love a good fisting; to others it\u2019s quiet unpleasant. A going concern for Baby was lost due to these methods. Resulting in lower bids for the company all around. Let\u2019s not forget that if chapter 7  were to actually happen, all of these deals go out the door. Except Overstock who becomes the base bid. Not to mention Overstock doesn\u2019t get to keep ip if they don\u2019t hand over a bankruptcy certificate. There are so many outs in these purchase agreements it doesn\u2019t make sense. Not to mention the ABL was paid off with 890 million in the bank left. If you look at the voting results the Filo was almost paid off, with about 24 million left; Docket 2140.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ufsq4kwrmunb1.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40f873c9fd739f943feafb8b1901b10fc04999f3\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/ufsq4kwrmunb1.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40f873c9fd739f943feafb8b1901b10fc04999f3\"></a></p>\n\n<p>So about 615 million in their coffers. Not including all the sales money in escrow or the 300 million in new money from notes. So I\u2019m not worried about \u201cliquidation\u201d or current FUD. Take a breather and go relax. I never post, always a lurker. Consider this a gift to calm you down. If this doesn\u2019t work, maybe try some fisting in honor of OverStock and Dream On Me            </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0y0s3iw0nunb1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92a13e136a0b994479d3f9b3b91a806f32681b55\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/0y0s3iw0nunb1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92a13e136a0b994479d3f9b3b91a806f32681b55\"></a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/vnXwl_ZUXCJySJYzdE6xlOicC_RQyFH0CaODkvAPJkA.jpg\"/></div>"}]
