So my understanding is that once the judge confirms the current plan is fully accepted, the blackout period will start at that time \u2014 and it seems about September 28 was when the current plan can be executed per his statement in Sept 12th hearing.  </p>\n\n<p>Question: So is the blackout period the time between the existing plan being confirmed and the execution date? Or is the blackout period another time period (yet to be determined) where no added changes, say for example adding on supplemental plan that includes shareholders can occur?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>and any thoughts on what could trigger us getting out of the expert market?
