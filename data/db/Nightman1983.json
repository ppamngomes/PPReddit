I\u2019ll make this a post post instead of a shit post. \nBuilding my position where I can, even if it\u2019s only $10 a day. In my opinion these type of plays don\u2019t come by too often.\n\u2022Bankruptcy had shorts go on hard\n\u2022Attempts to drop the price sub .01 were futile\n\u2022Large retail \u201ccult\u201d following ( I use cult like that cult following rocky horror picture show has)\n\u2022not many institutional buyer\n\u2022 Holly Etlin\n\u2022 lowered debt\n\u2022 both bbby and baby going concern likely \n\u2022 The fire ass DD here\n\u2022 Restructuring \n\u2022 The Hail Mary play Glenn mentioned \n\u2022 I smell desperation from shorts\n\u2022 The \ud83d\udd25 DD on these subs\n\u2022 The chart\n\u2022 The tinfoil </p>\n\n<p>These are just some of my reasons. I left RC and Icahn out because it\u2019s a good play even if neither has a hand in it ( although I\u2019m inclined to believe. So why wouldn\u2019t I buy something at .31 cents when I have conviction it\u2019s going a lot higher. So yea I\u2019ll throw whatever I can at it. \nI know some people have way bigger positions but at $30- $100 -$400 what\u2019s it going to matter? Shorts are fuked. I\u2019m not going to kid myself and think this is going to be over any time soon, these hedge funds have a lot of liquidity, and CTB ain\u2019t shit, but CTB is an excellent indicator to show the trend of shorts. \nWould be cool if someone could post ortex everyday here, ortex is useful. I\u2019m here for however long it takes, which I heard is somewhere around 84 years if I\u2019m not Mistaken.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ZScPRRy2tVYXiPD6lzMbl-8WCbqjcNWPMukGSLDOCvg.jpg\"/></div>"},

Had like 18k karma too.\nAnyway, I recently lost my job, I mean I know where it is but I got fired for asking for $2 more than what I was making. I guess that just comes with being a temp. Well before I got fired I managed to put some money into here and have 5879 shares at .21 cents, so I\u2019m relatively new to this stock. Now I\u2019m in a situation where it would be advantageous to sell, I am running around delivering groceries to try and make my bills ( not really working) . But regardless of my situation I would rather hold these shares and buy 10-20 dollars worth here and there. Most would see this as foolish and quite frankly I can care less, what\u2019s foolish is busting your ass for a job where you get fired for asking to make a living wage. Needless to say I believe in this play and can see from the stock chart a run to $7, 30, and quite possibly beyond. But if it goes to zero idgaf because an opportunity is worth a lot, more than the money put into it, and I rather not miss an opportunity like this. \nI held AMC from $10 to $70 and sold the rest at $30, I\u2019ve also been obsessed with watching the market and stock charts since then, I\u2019m 98 percent convinced this is going to run hard AF.\nWell that\u2019s my rant. I guess I\u2019m looking for encouragement and maybe to see if someone can relate. And I want to say I greatly appreciate most of y\u2019all\u2019s DD.\nOh and on a side note I was looking at trading view, their revenue seems to be 5 billion on average and that\u2019s only in the United States. I really think rebranding and taking bed bath to the beyond would bring mass tendies ( China)\nAnyway peace out, thanks for reading my shit post</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
