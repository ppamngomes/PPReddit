I was having warm and relaxing sauna while my regarded and hairy ape ass came up with a thought.</p>\n\n<p>#How did Porsche announce their majority of stake back in the 2008?#Or how did it come to the public knowledge?</p>\n\n<p>Apparently Facebook and Twitter weren&#39;t so valid sources of information back then, and is not today either. Im curious about that time in 2008. I was 11 year old dude playing playstation with my friends, so I remember nothing about VW-squeeze. So my point is, could we get any dockets or announcements from anywhere to read? I know I might sound desperate ape, cause I am, and this weekend has just been waiting for news/announcement, but still, im super curious. Is there any kind of information available, except news articles? Thank you very much before hand.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
