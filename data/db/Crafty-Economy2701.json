Right now i have no money left but i have this little feeling that this thing won&#39;t be so cheap anymore soon. In general i have 300-400\u20ac for stocks each month but i&#39;m thinking about tanking a loan for round about 3000\u20ac and make a one-buy right now and pay the loan for the next 10 months back. What do you guys think. It is maybe the last time so cheap, right?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

I&#39;m probably not as long in the game as many others here in this community. I more or less stumbled upon this community back in February this year. What naturally caught my attention was the rapid rise at the beginning of the year and the search for opportunities to make significant gains. Well, how should I put it, at that time I never thought about what I was getting into here. At the beginning, my goal was to turn a few hundred euros into a few thousand, but as more time passed and more puzzle pieces were uncovered, I began to realize how big this game would actually become. Since around early May, I&#39;ve been on an emotional rollercoaster with news about this stock. I can&#39;t quite believe it, but it seems that the puzzle may finally be solved over the next week. I&#39;m honestly so incredibly confident that this play will hit. In any case, I just wanted to say thanks to everyone in the community who has provided us with information, theories, and loads of memes. Since I live in Germany and wasn&#39;t able to transfer my stocks to IBKR for DRS, my shares are all in my regular brokerage account, but I hope that the German brokers won&#39;t release my stocks for now. Anyway, I&#39;m as sure as I&#39;ve ever been that this thing is going to explode, and we&#39;ll soon see the biggest Amazon rival ever.
