Celebrations are held throughout France. One that has been reported as &quot;the oldest and largest military parade in Europe is held on 14 July on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris in front of the President of the Republic, along with other French officials and foreign guests.</p>\n\n<p>History</p>\n\n<p>In 1789, tensions rose in France between reformist and conservative factions as the country struggled to resolve an economic crisis. In May, the Estates General legislative assembly was revived, but members of the Third Estate broke ranks, declaring themselves to be the National Assembly of the country, and on 20 June, vowed to write a constitution for the kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>On 11 July Jacques Necker, the finance minister of Louis XVI, who was sympathetic to the Third Estate, was dismissed by the King, provoking an angry reaction among Parisians. Crowds formed, fearful of an attack by the royal army or by foreign regiments of mercenaries in the King&#39;s service, and seeking to arm the general populace. Early on 14 July one crowd besieged the H\u00f4tel des Invalides for firearms, muskets, and cannons, stored in its cellars. That same day, another crowd stormed the Bastille, a fortress-prison in Paris that had historically held people jailed on the basis of lettres de cachet (literally &quot;signet letters), arbitrary royal indictments that could not be appealed and did not indicate the reason for the imprisonment, and was believed to hold a cache of ammunition and gunpowder. As it happened, at the time of the attack, the Bastille held only seven inmates, none of great political significance.</p>\n\n<p>The crowd was eventually reinforced by mutinous R\u00e9giment des Gardes Fran\u00e7aises (&quot;French Guards&quot;), whose usual role was to protect public buildings. They proved a fair match for the fort&#39;s defenders, and Governor de Launay, the commander of the Bastille, capitulated and opened the gates to avoid a mutual massacre. According to the official documents, about 200 attackers and just one defender died before the capitulation. However, possibly because of a misunderstanding, fighting resumed. In this second round of fighting, de Launay and seven other defenders were killed, as was Jacques de Flesselles, the pr\u00e9v\u00f4t des marchands (&quot;provost of the merchants&quot;), the elected head of the city&#39;s guilds, who under the feudal monarchy also had the competences of a present-day mayor.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after the storming of the Bastille, late in the evening of 4 August, after a very stormy session of the Assembl\u00e9e constituante, feudalism was abolished. On 26 August, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (D\u00e9claration des Droits de l&#39;Homme et du Citoyen) was proclaimed. </p>\n\n<p>One day the 741 prophecy will come to fruition.</p>\n\n<p>Hype always.</p>\n\n<p>To the moon and beyond Uranus.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
