I remember having seen something that outlined who all provided the Roll-up financing related to the DIP, and went searching for it to find this:  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uys4v97ss6sb1.png?width=835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b475073a3c1577060d2d9a498fc3e0b4c47fcacf\">Source: BBBY Form 8-K dated 4/23/23</a></p>\n\n<p>TAO Talents was actually the largest contributor to the Roll Up, with Sixth Street Lending Partners being next, followed by Sixth Street Specialty Lending. There was recently discovered that Sixth Street Lending Partners did an offering for Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities, which can be found here: <a href=\"https://capedge.com/filing/1925309/0001193125-23-247390/8K\">https://capedge.com/filing/1925309/0001193125-23-247390/8K</a></p>\n\n<p>They also did an Exempt Offering of Securities for $6B found here: <a href=\"https://capedge.com/filing/1925309/0001925309-23-000003/DA\">https://capedge.com/filing/1925309/0001925309-23-000003/DA</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>But look closely. Although the filing is under Sixth Street Lending Partners, there is a section that asks if the offering is being made in connection with a business combination transaction, such as a merger, acquisition or exchange offer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rg4x8dp7u6sb1.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0388022e09df3a34f088e1abdaae89d55fb35da5\">https://preview.redd.it/rg4x8dp7u6sb1.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0388022e09df3a34f088e1abdaae89d55fb35da5</a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s checked as no, which leads me to believe that this won&#39;t be used for any particular merger, acquisition, or exchange offer, but that question could also be related to Sixth Street being merged, acquired, or exchanged, so I can&#39;t draw a conclusion here.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I do, however, emphatically believe we need more eyes on this to try and determine what the securities were. We know that they check 506(b), and the SEC outlines what that is.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m4o6go39v6sb1.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=146f20888184def10439bc8935a1e504ba59ffc3\">https://preview.redd.it/m4o6go39v6sb1.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=146f20888184def10439bc8935a1e504ba59ffc3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h9aazxqzu6sb1.png?width=516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e492d6689676bced791e8bebd7139b45e8577bb1\">https://www.sec.gov/education/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/rule506b</a></p>\n\n<p>The first thing I see when I read this is that no general solicitation or advertising to market the securities. That makes me think that they had investors waiting and ready to purchase these, but I still can&#39;t figure out what they are for.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I believe that Sixth Street is selling securities for a new fund, as they outline this in the Form D:  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/62typepgv6sb1.png?width=189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2ed12653e2861ccbc16510eff2bb8d81a54d364\">https://preview.redd.it/62typepgv6sb1.png?width=189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2ed12653e2861ccbc16510eff2bb8d81a54d364</a></p>\n\n<p>This could be nothing more than an offering to have multiple investors invest in a new fund, so that Sixth Street can find new investment opportunities. What helps me lean into that theory is this:  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ar2fu1rrv6sb1.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1eb8367ae71bfb4a6c3ba29d47190ceb0b57b52\">https://preview.redd.it/ar2fu1rrv6sb1.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1eb8367ae71bfb4a6c3ba29d47190ceb0b57b52</a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s an amendment to already issued securities. It&#39;s not a first sale or a new notice. I believe that this is not for a SPAC, but for a new fund that Sixth Street is setting up under Sixth Street Lending Partners.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d appreciate more eyes on this, but I thought I would post my thoughts and findings after reading further into the filing.</p>\n\n<p>- Cheers</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/cXiAGi4VUTDzO2-uofkpgKV-4j8FA57iWF8_3S17WD4.jpg\"/></div>"},

The day after I said it couldn&#39;t be done... and it&#39;s done. Props to <a href=\"/u/Famous_variety\">u/Famous_variety</a> and their post here:  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/166ectl/rc_and_pals_have_control_through_the_series_a/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/166ectl/rc_and_pals_have_control_through_the_series_a/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Using this information, we we&#39;re able to work together to hypothesize, and then conclude, how the David Kastin puzzle gets solved. There is some minor speculation in here, and I&#39;m mostly going to write about how we got there rather than write about how it&#39;s 100% conclusive. It&#39;s not, but the riddle is solved.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>On page 64 of the 10-K, which can be found here: <a href=\"https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/financial-information/sec-filings?field_nir_sec_date_filed_value=&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;page=0\">https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/financial-information/sec-filings?field_nir_sec_date_filed_value=&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;page=0</a>, there is a small section shown below  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/59yg0htothlb1.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2803ac68a07ef4bc737f6912c055ccf6ede4849c\">Triggering event</a></p>\n\n<p>The second paragraph is what is important, and I&#39;m going to actually circle back to it, but bear with me. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So in the HBC deal, there were various types of securities/derivatives issued as shown below</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/d2qk1hywthlb1.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c38f0ee09cc23ec23044fe78c43a9aad90411ff8\">HBC deal</a></p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, it was headed by B Riley, but that&#39;s not important. So we had 23,685 share of preferred stock, 95,387,533 common stock warrants, and 84,216 preferred stock warrants. Thankfully, because of the 10-K we got quite a bit of information for what was converted, and what was exercised as shown below.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tbv1llasvhlb1.png?width=721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc23b508c8be0afb440d91e4d4c8a2c8e0e00d7b\">10-K information</a></p>\n\n<p>From the 10-K we, know that common stock warrants were exercised, preferred stock warrants were converted to preferred shares, and preferred shares were exercised for 70.9M common shares.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This is where <a href=\"/u/Famous_variety\">u/Famous_variety</a> and I went to work on discord to solve the remaining puzzle. We know from Holly Etlin&#39;s declaration that there were 180 shares of preferred stock at the time of filing chapter 11, but that means we were missing the piece where 24,174 preferred shares were exercised for common stock.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>There were several approaches to take: 1) using the 13,543 preferred share conversion to get an approximate number, 2) estimate the shares based on the average price during the time, or 3) calculate the amount using $10,000/share price. The problem with 3 is we don&#39;t know what share price, BUT we may be able to estimate where they were trying to go.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Quick tangent: we know they are trying to preserve the NOLs by keeping equity holders maintaining at least 50% ownership. We also know that TSO is 739,056,836 (per Etlin declaration). So 49.9% ownership would be 368,789,361 shares of common stock.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Back on track: using option 1, gave us 126.5M shares, but the share price wouldn&#39;t compute properly. Using option 2 we got 287M shares. Then we thought, what if we take the difference from what we know and the 49.9% amount of shares to find the difference. So we calculated it out and it would be 178,878,361 as shown below:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/903waiv4xhlb1.png?width=87&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7f1b35c5f38c18f27d0ecd147de4cd36dde62ba\">49.9&#37; common shares</a></p>\n\n<p>That falls within the range, and we then did some magic algebraic type math, and figured that would equal the share price at $0.74 when they were exercised. Between 2/27/2023 and 4/23/2023 there was only one day that the share price was that price</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bjsmrqyfxhlb1.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf7f130ea7647d5588f4a047c7de63e3e8c736b7\">Historical information from yahoo</a></p>\n\n<p>That would leave someone with 49.9% ownership, 180 preferred shares at the time of filing bankruptcy, and they could&#39;ve even sold some shares to fall below the 49.9% to possibly exercise the 180 preferred shares.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now let&#39;s go back to the beginning. Remember this?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yuxgiky6yhlb1.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38edefc0b4b765a2db979e6de5a5c15308e2d3a0\">Triggering Event</a></p>\n\n<p>Filing for bankruptcy caused a triggering event of the preferred stock. Well if something is owed to someone that would make that person a creditor. Hmm... who&#39;s a creditor listed in the dockets that could possibly also be owed shares of preferred stock? Are you following?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now if that person is holding 49.9% ownership, and those preferred shares are converted and delivered, that could put them over the threshold to preserve the NOLs. Also, there was a conversion of preferred warrants to preferred shares where someone was given 10M shares and a possible 5M upon voting approval for the Reverse Split. &quot;It&#39;s very important you vote for the reverse split&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Maybe that someone wouldn&#39;t want more shares. Well that&#39;s okay because there is a mandatory cash redemption that is triggered in the above picture, making someone a creditor at the time of filing. So someone or some entity is owed something, but then that someone/entity would then be the person/holder of all the other shares that were converted (unless they were sold, which we can assume they weren&#39;t as they aren&#39;t voting shares, and we know the count of voting shares.). That would mean that someone/entity is holding 368,789,361 shares, which is 49.9% ownership.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>...and that is how we solved the David Kastin puzzle.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ki1qtz07zhlb1.png?width=721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd946f0ff21ae91a94c85f1314fa5382b1e37daf\">The completed puzzle</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I know there is room for error in this, but it plays. We know option 1 and option 2 from the top can&#39;t necessarily work based on $10,000/stock price, and the numbers don&#39;t align. That&#39;s why we never knew the float. The float is still tough to determine as well because then we invite in B Riley&#39;s deals and that gets more complex, but if someone is holding the speculated 368M shares, then we know the float is under 368M.  </p>\n\n<p>This was a fun one. It&#39;s not perfect because we don&#39;t know the true conversion of those shares, but this is the only way the pieces of the puzzle fit to complete the picture.   </p>\n\n<p>Side note: I can&#39;t call this the Mona Lisa bc JPM&#39;s ABL is the Mona Lisa. This one is my Sistine Chapel, lol  </p>\n\n<p>Cheers, everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/EYl_XSxkeVQfhjMK9QYeAxWqtWqF5RA6-vRytjMYpn4.jpg\"/></div>"},

What it is, what it means, and why the term is used very particularly.", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Good morning, afternoon, or evening, to all you amazing regards all over the world. It&#39;s been a minute since I have done a write up that was worthy of being a post, but I got a nice little gem for y&#39;all. I would like to thank <a href=\"/u/K7Phi\">u/K7Phi</a> for letting me know where to find this information, and though we may be far apart, this user was able to use the internet to point me in the right direction. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve heard the term used over and over again. &quot;We didn&#39;t receive any qualified bids...&quot;, &quot;There weren&#39;t enough qualified bid...&quot;, &quot;qualified bids....&quot;, yada yada yada. So what the f@*&amp; is a &quot;qualified bid&quot;. Well docket 92 outlines exactly what a &quot;qualified bid&quot; is. It begins on page 20 of that docket, shown here:  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0wu4d0p6cqbb1.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8752218570108c532adc2b64c25235907a49f742\">Page 20 of docket 29</a></p>\n\n<p>This. This is what we have been looking for. Again, for all those who don&#39;t understand how and why things get included in legal doc and how important they can be, items in legal docs are included for a variety of different reasons: a) as an &quot;in case&quot;, b) to cover their asses, c) to outline precisely what a term may or may not involve. </p>\n\n<p>Again, docket 1117 and 1275 outlined exactly what the term &quot;Alternative Transaction&quot; means. I found it odd on Monday when I ran across it that the term &quot;Alternative transaction&quot; was defined and outlined on both dockets, yet at the time, had little to no meaning. It wasn&#39;t until the 8K came out yesterday, that we saw that BBBY is still soliciting for an Alternative transaction.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7bptpaf0dqbb1.png?width=765&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbe58cb423ce2a12678463f92817daf6a4abbf5b\">8-K dated 7/12/2023</a></p>\n\n<p>Just like an alternative transaction (side note: I love me some alternative transactions), a qualified bid has been defined as well. However, a qualified bid has 26 different criteria that must be met in order for it to be considered a qualified bid. Twenty-six... That seems like a lot. I don&#39;t want to sit here and bore everybody with the little details, but I will post the images, and basically walk through the quick and ugly.</p>\n\n<p>We saw in the first screenshot that each qualified bid must clearly state the asset to be purchased, liabilities and obligations assumed, and whether or not the bidder expects to operate the business as a going-concern. We also know that a 10% deposit of the bid amount must be made in cash. If the bid was for the business and the bid was several billion (hypothetically), the deposit would be in the several hundred millions. Cool. Let&#39;s continue.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/skfnpw9udqbb1.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8676da93cce83a7caefcb21b6a791f3cd5040ee1\">Just read it, and don&#39;t be lazy</a></p>\n\n<p>The bid must identify the cash and non-cash components and bid documents that outline everything.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/041i37k5eqbb1.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6a23bbb1d926c5fcf163371bf10f0af35d86166\">https://preview.redd.it/041i37k5eqbb1.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6a23bbb1d926c5fcf163371bf10f0af35d86166</a></p>\n\n<p>It also must be prepared to enter into (think of complete documents ready to sign) and consummate in the form of purchase agreement. It must include a clause where the bidder understands they are not entitled to a break-up fee as well.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/iodncmkleqbb1.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71e8d61fdbef22f192036c491be492442bb6b82f\">https://preview.redd.it/iodncmkleqbb1.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71e8d61fdbef22f192036c491be492442bb6b82f</a></p>\n\n<p>It must include clauses about employees and their retentions, etc, the source of financing (if any), and must contain no contingencies regarding the binding nature of the bid. Ok... this is getting a little picky especially considering were only at H and the list goes through Z... Let&#39;s continue.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ug0ncw2weqbb1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f67cb0f5db08ebda3c3c03117f872865da27cebd\">https://preview.redd.it/ug0ncw2weqbb1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f67cb0f5db08ebda3c3c03117f872865da27cebd</a></p>\n\n<p>Ugh.

Wasn&#39;t something said about needing this done &quot;by the end of July&quot; in the hearing? Hmm... I&#39;m speculating what that could&#39;ve meant, but let&#39;s finish up this list of requirements.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qcctqsqkfqbb1.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=897c3951741a2093bf0c0c3d0adb0e74e9f0570f\">https://preview.redd.it/qcctqsqkfqbb1.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=897c3951741a2093bf0c0c3d0adb0e74e9f0570f</a></p>\n\n<p>Almost there....</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ypuopgspfqbb1.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eef31c453cc8cef05049dc48fdb7ff0e84d9a507\">Boom</a></p>\n\n<p>There is it. Only the bids fulfilling all those 26 requirements may be deemed &quot;qualified bids&quot;. This is what I have been saying. It&#39;s not that BBBY hasn&#39;t received &quot;bids&quot; or &quot;enough bids&quot; or &quot;high enough bids&quot;. It&#39;s that they haven&#39;t received any &quot;qualified bids&quot;. The terminology and definitions are important, just like the definition of &quot;Alternative transaction&quot; is important (still love me some alternative transactions). </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So, in short and in closing: 1) fuk the shills, 2) BBBY probably received plenty of &quot;bids&quot;, but only a few select, yet not high enough, &quot;qualified bids&quot;, 3) BBBY is continuing to solicit inquiries, proposals, and offers from third parties related in connection with any &quot;alternative transaction&quot;, and 4) the separate auctions for BBBY and/or Baby do not qualify as &quot;alternative transactions&quot; as alternative transaction can not include just the sale of Harmon of Baby, but must include the entire business.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This is what I have been trying to get at for some time now, and I want to thank <a href=\"/u/K7Phi\">u/K7Phi</a>, who seems to be a loyal, bold, and true ape, for pointing out the docket.

Current TSO based on information available is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Common Stock Outstanding:</th>\n<th align=\"left\">586,843,262</th>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Reserved for options &amp; warrants</td>\n<td align=\"left\">18,320,144</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Reserved (not issued)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Series A Convertible Preferred Stock</td>\n<td align=\"left\">122,355,810</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Reserved (not issued)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Issuance pursuant to exchange agreement</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5,000,000</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Reserved (not issued)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Total Shares Outstanding</td>\n<td align=\"left\">739,056,836</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hold on, stripper boy. Why do you keep changing this?&quot; Well with more information comes a better understanding. Let&#39;s walk through what Significant-Bowler23 pointed out, and I will walk you all through how we get to the end.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6hky9n87u05b1.png?width=1338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ca2873a212ec83e50f6b989d603b4b629034024\">updated spreadsheet</a></p>\n\n<p>So, I was wrong about the 100.1M shares already issued as it related to the S-1. That&#39;s because the 100.1M shares issued was related to the S-3 with B Riley securities in their $300M offering. As of the date of the S-1, approximately 100.1M shares had been issued for the B Riley deal, not for the S-1. That changes things, and I did go back and confirm that here:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2oni9hs9s05b1.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08878ecd775f63aa3a3cc750ef4c15688aafde4d\">https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/4f8724e9-6246-4336-a0d4-281c7ed3bc27</a></p>\n\n<p>So, since those shares had been issued not in relation to the S-1, when form RW was issued, and the S-1 withdrawn, that only withdrew the offering for the 111M shares offered in the S-1.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m4zpprcis05b1.png?width=712&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82d1c617af8f6aa47aaec28c160ab38a3ef54c7f\">S-1 offering</a></p>\n\n<p>So we can see in the green section that BBBY issued approximately 100.1M shares related to the BRS deal, they still had about 178.2M shares available to issue related to that deal, and had 111.7M shares available from the S-1. However, if we had 428M shares, and approximately 100.1M shares were issued related to BRS, then why isn&#39;t it 528M? I think that some warrants may have been converted for the difference, and I continue to research that. I remember seeing somewhere that some were converted, but I still need to find it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So the S-1 states that shares of BBBY outstanding as of 4/10/2023 was 558,735,983.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xi8pk9r3t05b1.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0d7ff0a0e8af0c0eb206c3ae75cf282d4c37cec\">S-1</a></p>\n\n<p>It also goes into more detail about shares that are restricted but are not part of the 558.7M</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/125odi8ct05b1.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2960218aa0b3c0d8e10e426febf15a2c13dc180\">S-1</a></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I believe after walking through this again with this additional information, we can conclude that 558.7M are the shares outstanding that would be considered the &quot;float&quot;, whereas the cumulative 145,675,954 shares in the picture above are part of the TSO, but are restricted.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So, let&#39;s talk stocks/shares and learn just a bit.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ol4x8090u05b1.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0afbb3fa1645dfcdb2d7c3dad1df3bf91e7927ea\">thanks random google image</a></p>\n\n<p>There are various terms for different &quot;batches&quot; of shares. Authorized shares are the 900M shares that BBBY has that they are authorized to issue. They have issued 739M shares. Of those, 6.5M are treasury, and 145.7M shares are restricted, leaving 586.8M shares of &#39;float&#39;, which can be traded publicly.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Again, we still don&#39;t know if any of the shares from these deals are closely held. I would assume the shares from B. Riley are not, as I went back and looked at the charts and it looks like they were sold on the open market. The HBC shares could still be closely held, but we don&#39;t know. Best case, 275M in the market, 311M held close by HBC. That&#39;s what I&#39;m coming up with as of now.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This stuff is complex, and not everything I put out is going to be what everyone wants to hear, but I try to be as forthcoming as possible with information. We are still waiting on stalking horse, we know what could be lurking for all of us. I look forward to hearing everyone&#39;s thoughts on these new developments, and I will continue to update everyone as new information becomes available.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7o1skw8hv05b1.png?width=1341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25e529227c494d9d7d3b9bfdeaded8d96faacb35\">The top green is where I believe we currently stand as of now</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/u9ZJ1zRIk-WfkYfpIsVQNqqw3yd3FDpNNjrz8mJ3ycs.jpg\"/></div>"},

Hundred of thousands of numbers with ever changing landscapes. It&#39;s a complex puzzle, dockets show one number, S-1 shows an accumulation of numbers, etc., etc.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll get to the point, I promise, but first I&#39;m lamenting on how I was using dockets dated 4/23 to get to a TSO number, only to be so deep in the proxies that I forgot they cancelled the S-1 in entirety. I hate being wrong, and I&#39;m humbly admitting that I was wrong. I was partially right, because as of 4/23/23, the TSO was 739M, but that&#39;s as far as I had gotten yesterday, and with the withdrawal of the S-1, the final TSO can only be...... drum roll please.... 428M.

I list the name of the proxy material in the first column, the date of publication, and the as of date for the date of reference. 10-Qs and 10-K are typically best for this, but we don&#39;t have any good recent ones. The last being from 01/26/2023 using an as of date of 11/26/2022. So... I had to use what I had that was concise and informative. I did my best to outline whatever information the proxy material provided, and I hope it is clear in my spreadsheet above.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I still can&#39;t believe I forgot the RW was as of 4/28. I&#39;m really kicking myself this morning. I mean, in my defense, I was reading proxy materials and dockets for about five hours yesterday (which is the most grueling read on the planet) trying to get all the information I could for everyone, and I still believe that I was correct up until 4/23/2023. BUT, the RW cancelled the S-1. That could leave questions unanswered, like &#39;what about the approximate 100.1M shares the S-1 issued?&#39;. So let&#39;s jump right in this morning, and have a good morning read as the caffeine kicks in.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8f41xljymz4b1.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a7b8fd536d27a3e7f106a4a85da1c320b5c5a57\">Form RW</a></p>\n\n<p>Everything get confusing in all this, and I think David Kastin designed it that way on purpose to bear trap SHFs. I digress. &quot;No securities have been or will be issued or sold pursuant to...&quot; this Form RW as is related to the S-1. There it is. That changes everything that I had gotten through yesterday. Again, I had gotten through 4/23/2023, and as of 4/23/2023 the TSO was 739M. Subsequent to the filing of Form RW, TSO can only be 428M.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Again, I was following the timeline and there was a lot to go through. I&#39;ll take the scrutiny as deserved, but more than that, I will take some community support. Yes, these things are difficult and tough to understand unless you happen to be a securities lawyer (hint: I am not), but I would love feedback to see if anyone here can find anything different. Point out if I missed something. Let&#39;s crowd-source this.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>By that I mean, someone prove me wrong regarding the spreadsheet above. I&#39;m all for criticism right now (as deserved), but also critiquing, so we can solve this puzzle once and for all.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As always, cheers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/aITGSddUrJi_jHmsR7T6C6-r3rqZWH97BXZ33XyUg9Y.jpg\"/></div>"},

BBBY engaged Lazard Freres in August... one week before RC sold his stake.", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>First off... I need a life... seriously...</p>\n\n<p>Second, I found some juice details in the retention of Lazard Freres as investment banker that might prove really juicy.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s up, apes? Ook ook, and happy fucking Friday. I was bored and digging through the bankruptcy documents and ran across a small tidbit of information that I thought needed to be shared. In docket 345 of the bankruptcy hearing, found <a href=\"https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/bbby/Home-DocketInfo\">here</a>, Lazard Freres is being retained as the investment banker for any sales transaction and restructuring.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Cool, but travis_b13 we already know that... loser.&quot; Yes, but within the engagement letter I found something even more interesting. Bear with me as I get through this. Within the engagement letter of Lazard, dated March 21, 2023 is this little juicy bit, located on page 7:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n327idzufv0b1.png?width=656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61cf42298c3f6b9a23a914f83219dbf7c6a4c962\">page 7 of Lazard Freres engagement letter</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So on August 10, 2022, Lazard Freres entered into an agreement with BBBY through another engagement of some sort to be indemnified. But why would they need to be indemnified? Honestly, I don&#39;t know, but I can speculate. Let&#39;s just continue and see if we can&#39;t get more information....</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/298b7eslgv0b1.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8cf4e97589473b8c41815a652fdb2dc931ee01f\">later in Lazard&#39;s engagement letter</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So... Lazard and BBBY had an engagement letter and also a Dealer Manager Agreement, but the Dealer Manager Agreement were dated October, 2022. Hmm... What the fuck is a Dealer Manager Agreement? Google....?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mpg4oqvtgv0b1.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=271ad0e83561a30bdf3094dc8365b9e145b85656\">Dealer Manager Agreement</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Hmm... interesting. So BBBY has entered into a separate engagement letter with Lazard on August 10, 2022. Why is that date seem important. What happened around that date?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p8qpvjp4hv0b1.png?width=1381&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=194aeb25680037835ce83c1efa3b3c6ffc43b7bf\">RC Ventures Edgar search</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Okay, travis_b13, but RC sold after the engagement letter was signed between Lazard and BBBY. Shouldn&#39;t he have sold before?&quot; To that I would say why would he sell before a company has been found and engaged to carry out the transaction.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>We already know that BABY is on the chopping block as it is mention exclusively twice in the docket 345 as part of the restructuring and possible sale. RC has been mentioned in documents as an interested party in quite a few court document and they even redacted an exhibit of interested parties for confidentiality. Yes, this is speculation, but I&#39;ve been in accounting for years, and this all lines up with how business is typically conducted in legal docs and transaction. Not only that but RC&#39;s letter to the board stated that they should sell BABY, and then a firm was engaged to head up a financial transaction days before RC sold...?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m speculating here, but based on my experience, you come to a hand-shake deal, engage an independent firm to carry out said deal, and then you make yourself independent of the business to carry out said deal at &quot;arms-length&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Again, speculation, but this just seems really juicy to me without flat-out stating what they were previously engaged for. Anyways... maybe it&#39;s something we can discuss further. Let me hear your thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Z7SkhDr1XHr7mBSlDTBuVqpYak_3LzYq9h4aosKMzTc.jpg\"/></div>"}]
