Today the stock is going down, despite confirmation from the company that this funding was reviewed by the SEC and that next week they will release more information.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially they did the same thing to novo that they did to IEP. They have a huge short position and released an official looking attack letter.

I&#39;m currently studying for my master&#39;s of science in accounting and reading some good books so fuck you shills im not responding to you I&#39;ve been in audit for years and all my work has been under ndas. I&#39;ve worked with courts and governments and literally you&#39;re all fucking dense</p>\n\n<p>In regards to industry, COVID caused a general decline. You could argue that stimmy checks or whatever boosted consumer spending power, but that was not true in the experience of me and the people around me. Many people have had very little money for luxuries that bbby offers. I have believed that the poor economic situation our world is in has been partly responsible for bbbys decline. In the long term as the world recovers, this industry will shine. </p>\n\n<p>Lawsuits is obvious. Ryan fucking Cohen and the dumb \ud83c\udf1d lawsuit. Literally comical if you think rc was a pumper dumper for that. Dumbasses.</p>\n\n<p>The stock is down 95%? Or is it 99%? Idk I don&#39;t care as much as you uneducated shills do, and quite honestly you&#39;re going to tell me in the comments so I appreciate your help. Yup it&#39;s been a huge argument of the shills this whole time. &quot;The stock is down whatever to date... You&#39;re still buying it???&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The last two sentences explain why shills may either experience infinite losses or I may lose some money that meant nothing to me. Overreaction is frequent? </p>\n\n<p>I hate to be arrogant because I may lose a VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF MY NET WORTH THAT WILL FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY RUIN ME. Oh wait no I fucking won&#39;t. </p>\n\n<p>Please understand that reasonable (not yoloing) investments into bankrupt securities has always been a valid and worthwhile strategy used by intelligent investors. Deny it at your own risk. I want you to experience infinite loss. I have nothing to lose, you have everything.</p>\n\n<p>The second image was just to highlight one important sentence. &quot;Almost all companies are in economically viable situations almost all the time&quot;. They&#39;ve trimmed debt, removed unwanted assets and believe it or not there is more value in the structure of this company than just a few storefronts. This industry will never die. People will want nice towels, bed sheets and goods for their children. Bbby is cheap and a great purchase currently.</p>\n\n<p>Call me an idiot. My citations for my research are actual books and experience from my work. I am actually educated and have worked in this fucking field unlike you shills. </p>\n\n<p>Source</p>\n\n<p>VALUE INVESTING: from Graham to Buffett and BEYOND by Bruce Greenwald and Judd Kahn </p>\n\n<p>how crazy that the title of the book includes fucking warren Buffett and BEYOND. Believe me, Ryan Cohen is warran Icahn. He understands VALUE INVESTING AND HOSTILE CORPORATE TAKEOVERS. You are not him. You will never be him. CoHeN neVeR went tO CoLLeGe. But I&#39;m damn sure he is well read. He most likely read buffet&#39;s favorite book, &quot;the intelligent investor&quot; written by Benjamin Graham who&#39;s style of investing inspired Greenwald and Kahn to write the book I cited here. This is how Ryan Cohen is thinking about investing. He confirmed himself to be a (deep fucking) value investor by saying he is warren icahn. Nobody who speaks as eloquently as he does and who has been so successful in business would be a fucking idiot the way you think he is.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": " \ud83d\udd2c Microscopic PP", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/C3D8SVEdmgKeOmu8AiBlLBFaKUoMZAUdrhAvKWdgScU.jpg\"/></div>"},
