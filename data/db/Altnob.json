I see a lot of people playing into a billionaire who likes to get off on being right. He knows the meme stock holders are going to see his attempts as &quot;desperate&quot; and he wants to appear desperate so at the end of this he can say, &quot;see? I told you so.&quot; and make it all about him being right.</p>\n\n<p>Billionaires are the most egotistical people imaginable and they will insert themselves where they have no business being just to appear &quot;smart.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m looking at both sides here and I feel like a lot of you aren&#39;t. There&#39;s a real possibility this stock is cancelled and people lose everything. </p>\n\n<p>I guess my point is, if it does, are you going to look back at all your posts about how &quot;desperate&quot; he is and reflect on that or are you just gonna double down and point fingers? BBBYQ is quite literally in the ramen or lambo phase . I&#39;m honestly tired of the hive mentality surrounding these stocks and would greatly appreciate more content that covers both sides instead of just the &quot;we&#39;re right&quot; side. </p>\n\n<p>People say &quot;MOON&quot; but don&#39;t understand the complexity of what is actually going to happen if these stocks do moon. &quot;Be greedy when others are fearful.&quot; yea, well the fearful ones are the ones who actually control things so I&#39;m not sure how far that can really go. Generational wealth sounds a lot like the government intervening and capping prices. &quot;But people will lose faith in the stock market if they do that.&quot; how much bullshit has happened already and nothing has changed? </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re not allowed to have these kinds of thoughts posted publicly on any of the other subs surrounding &quot;meme stocks&quot; because you just get banned, shilled and shunned. <strong>No one wants to hear the other side where we all lose but I think managing those expectations is more important than ignoring them.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff4500"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
