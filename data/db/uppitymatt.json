Expert Market is part of the plan. My thoughts last night was they can\u2019t blame retail when the price starts to rocket because we can\u2019t buy on Expert Market. Look at the narrative they have pushed on meme stocks and retail investors. They can\u2019t use that anymore. 150k shares DRSed came for the short squeeze staying for market reform and justice. Also been traveling for work so behind on episodes and listened to Wednesday\u2019s episode last night\u2026what a great community of people. Proud to be here love to be associated with this type of highly regarded and caring individuals. It\u2019s been an honor being here</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BLACK TAR TINFOIL", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ff66ac"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
