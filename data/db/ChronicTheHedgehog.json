All shorts are future buyers. GME famously sold shares into a squeeze while stock was elevated to raise money, a clear, recent, and relevant example of how squeezes can create value for companies and shareholders. </p>\n\n<p>An emergence from bankruptcy at this point all but guarantees shorts have to close. Would new money not value that potential, knowing they\u2019d be more than made whole if the new company were to use the same maneuver to raise money? And that they could be in on that equity based on the deal they make? Let alone the potential of the going concern / future org that emerges. It\u2019s been done, and it\u2019s not too late. </p>\n\n<p>Am I missing something in that portion of the bull thesis, or is there a reason that\u2019s not being considered by bears?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
