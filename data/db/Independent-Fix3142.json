It is curious that they are doing earnings a week earlier than expected.  I am positive Bbby will have earnings around the 28th as well. Probably on the 28th. What if bbby cash flow neutral?  This is Friday of opex settlement week. Would be epic if there is a \u201cnatural\u201d run that week anyway due to opex settlement. Then Newell announces a merger which send the stock running even higher. Then On May 8th they go ahead and do the reverse split forcing a share recall and kicking off another run while un-diluting our stock. I call it the ultimate mayhem scenario. Don\u2019t get your hopes up. But, that would be wild.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "", "text_color": "", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
