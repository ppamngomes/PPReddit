I\u2018m aware that this sounds FUDdy, but hear me out and..    </p>\n\n<p>..let me elaborate:<br/>\nSo my boiled down understanding is that some no-name lawyer dude (acting for somebody else) injected this crazy number into butterfly and now made the rightful claim to get (some of) it back.. if accepted, the sheer size of his claim translates into him being a very powerful voice in negotiations about the company\u2019s future. He may ultimately transform (part of) this claim into a credit bid which would/could result in him having full control over the company.   </p>\n\n<p>So what is the argument against this being a move by <em>a short</em> who is desperately trying to cover his ass from our beloved unlimited loss? Like <em>\u201ehere are 10 Billion - let me take control.. and btw fuck the NOLs\u201c</em> \u2026 with the single purpose to whipe out existing shareholders and to get away with quite a few scratches and bruises, but still alive.   </p>\n\n<p>Who or how could this move be countered?   </p>\n\n<p>Thanks..<br/>\nand btw please don\u2019t try to buy a silver <strong>Porsche GT3 Touring</strong> with manual gearbox after all of this.. the one I fell in love with is trading at ~400k already and the last thing I need is a bunch of well-hung boys with <em>fuck you money</em> that <del>want</del> need one as well</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
