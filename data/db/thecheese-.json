Kirkland lawyer clarified by saying us shareholders won\u2019t receive anything from the $895 Million made from the IPs, Leases, Stores etc. BUT what was also said is that they\u2019re working on maximizing value for all stakeholders. I believe that BBBY Inc. is now a shell company that has a insane amount of short interest. That being said i can imagine that Kirkland lawyers know this and will use this as an advantage for us.
