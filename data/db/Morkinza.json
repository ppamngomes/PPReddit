Since it&#39;s delisted, we aren&#39;t able to move them to your non-registered until it becomes active again. We are still currently waiting for an update regarding BBBYQ as well as it&#39;s still in the process of being liquidated.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of CRA, you wouldn&#39;t receive a penalty if you and when you are able to sell it. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps!</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,\nAGENT NAME,\nThe Wealthsimple Team\nFor answers to common questions, check out our FAQs</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
