Either baby is bought and we spin off or bed bath and baby go together and build out the e-commerce side while keeping profitable bed bath stores. \nThe idea of baby being sold and the funds going directly to debt and then me just having shares in bed bath while they try to turn around without having baby is not the solution I\u2019m looking for. \nHelp me understand, not a shill, I\u2019m still hodling til the end to the tune of 12,xxx I just need some hope from everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83e\ude78 Dead Inside \ud83e\ude78", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
