Hearing now that RC is looking to our opinion is amazing, as he&#39;s willing to listen to us. However, this also concerns me to some extent, as this could mean that RC has nothing on the table as of now. Or maybe they do have, and look for even more options.</p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t seen the community do too much brainstorm on this so I&#39;d like to open the door, and maybe through joint effort we can put something coherent together.</p>\n\n<p>What profitable companies could GameStop acquire right away to augment or complement their business? While VR is good, blockchain, game studios and such are good for long term, on the short term they don&#39;t have capacity to generate revenue and profit as it takes time to develop the products.</p>\n\n<p>Some things that come to my smooth brain would be capturing smaller companies that already sell similar products they already do, to capture market share and customers: companies that sell pc parts and and collectibles. But we need names and more research what would be great candidates.</p>\n\n<p>Let me hear your thoughts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
