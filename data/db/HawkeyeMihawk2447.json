And don&#39;t plan to bring anymore inventory. The Vegas center was one of bbby most active centers in the west coast according to him. So, I wanted to share with everyone. But the mods took my post down, because this community is a stupid fucking echo chamber. I think is to late make our voices heard. I hope maybe we can have leverage for a class action lawsuit. But that sounds stupid to idk. I know people are grasping for straws and hoping for the best, but we can&#39;t be blind to what is really happening.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ya9i129qdcxa1.jpeg?width=1636&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=998a49d9c894d2b6ef50323fe6149f420958fcc6\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/ya9i129qdcxa1.jpeg?width=1636&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=998a49d9c894d2b6ef50323fe6149f420958fcc6\" alt=\" \"></a>So, I have a family member working at a Las Vegas BBBY fulfillment center. They are trying to empty out the warehouse by July and shutting down the fulfillment center. They are continuing to let people go. Their Las Vegas fulfillment center was one of their most productive and important fulfillment centers in the west coast. They have told their employees that they will be going through the bankruptcy. This is honestly not looking good. I don&#39;t believe there will be a white Knight. This is not looking good. But this is just my opinion and wanted to share this. Good luck to us all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\u26a0\ufe0f Shill \u26a0\ufe0f", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
