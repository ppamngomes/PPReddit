There have already been a few movies and documentaries over the last couple years and most recently the hit piece \u2018Making of the Meme King\u2019. \n\nNeedless to say there will be hype surrounding Dumb Money which is set to be released September 22 this year. We know how the media feels about Ryan Cohen. We know how Ryan Cohen feels about doubters. We also know he\u2019s put a lot of his own money where his mouth is. \n\nI direct you to the monthly and yearly charts for GME. This is important because if you believe in Ryan Cohens involvement, then you also believe in what happens to GME. \n\nThe monthly chart has the moving averages rolling over to the downside, but there is strong support around 9.50 as noted on the green trend line. Likewise on the yearly chart the 20 day ema is around 9.50. \n\nIt would not surprise me as we patiently wait for the BBBYQ squeeze we see GME falling, especially if there is one last big dip before the rip. Now align this with the movie release date for September 22. \n\nHow was GME successful in squeezing back in 2021? Hype and aggressive retail buyers. Does anyone remember a little movie titled The Wolf of Wall Street? It\u2019s what originally got me excited to invest back in 2013. Who\u2019s to say Dumb Money doesn\u2019t light a similar spark to bring in a new wave of money hungry retail investors? \n\nIn my view, if we\u2019re waiting a few more months as well this could be the start of another meme stock movement. Especially if there are current references or hints of the fact that it might happen again. \n\nTo be continued?", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"default\"/></div>"},
