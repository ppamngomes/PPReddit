If you haven&#39;t and fear MOASS related issues, remember that it&#39;ll unfold over days. Like in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>But while I personally want to DRS for myself... We might be already set for liftoff...</p>\n\n<p>Whatever is going on with bbbyq... they want to move and move fast.</p>\n\n<p>They may have also planned for a contingency plan if they were forced to wait fourteen days... </p>\n\n<p>I believe things are in motion.
