Warning for you all", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Sorry don&#39;t want to make this a long post or sob story but want to server as a warning. I just got permanently suspended from Reddit after having disagreements on the home bobby sub with shills. Something about harassment or something. Anyways Just want to serve as a reminder during these times we have to follow the rules to the fucking dot. Commenting over there is very risky so make sure to never lose your cool and always play by the rules as they have an army ready to report you. Sucks possibly losing 8+ year-old account due to some bobby shill but life lesson I suppose. Hoping the investigation goes my way into my account but wont hold my breath.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways good luck y&#39;all I think we right about this and sounds like we will soon find out. Want to thank this community for being the bright light in a dark tunnel.</p>\n\n<p>If you can I would say avoid the main bobby sub as its obviously been compromised for a very long time. I do respect all you dd posters who go over there to share info with the bobbys who don&#39;t know about this place yet. You are truly needed in this community.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
