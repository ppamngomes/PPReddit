I hold 10,200 shares.  Was here for the first run up.  Down a lot of money.  I have positions in GME and AMC as well.  I don\u2019t plan to sell (don\u2019t think I can anymore) but I\u2019m just having hard time with the filings.  If these shares were going to be transferred why wouldn\u2019t the filings just say \u201cthese shares will be cancelled but may have value for consideration in the future.\u201d  Or some verbiage like that.  </p>\n\n<p>Also for a M&amp;A, why wait until the 11th hour.  Why didn\u2019t this happen months ago or weeks ago.  I\u2019m still optimistic, but I\u2019m just tired of getting this wrong and my emotions go back and forth.  Shorts still fucked though in my books!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
