I respect u-copy, but he tries to use TA in a way it\u2019s not meant for, like using a hammer on a screw. \n\nTA is only accurate to a high degree on short term time frames. Yes, cycles exist, but there\u2019s two problems with trading on cycles alone. \n\n1. Cycles break. \n\n2. As we\u2019ve seen, cycles can vary on exact time frame. The difference of 2-3 weeks can be enormous in terms of price action, especially with a highly manipulated stock like BBBYQ.\n\nSo how is TA actually supposed to be used? The answer is either for people who purely day trade, or like deep value said, as ONE of multiple tools in investing, such as for specific entries and exits within a cycle. If you identify a cycle and understand the fundamentals, then TA is used in the short term to show when the cycle beginning and end are confirmed or denied. \n\nAlso, TA only requires the use of volume and price movement. Think of volume like the amount of gas going into the engine, and think of price action like the direction of the steering wheel. Price shows movement and volume confirms it. The problem is that the amount of volume needed to \u201cconfirm\u201d a breakout or prove that its a fakeout is arbitrary. Thats where indicators come in: they\u2019re quantitative measures that help to prove whether a movement can be confirmed or ignored. My issue with u-copy is that he attempts to use them alone, ignoring volume, which is the incorrect way to use those tools, making uninformed people believe that TA is irrelevant here. I promise you that legit day traders are making a killing on this. \n\nI dont know how to add pictures on reddit, im new to this place, but imagine the bull flag that u-copy kept showing. \u201cBull flags\u201d are actually just ranges. Again, if i knew how to add pictures, i would include an example of a \u201cbull flag\u201d that ends up breaking to the downside. Flags, in reality, are just ranges. Support and resistance lines are legitimate, but you CANNOT predict which way price will break with a HIGH degree of accuracy. Remember, as time frame increases, the accuracy of TA begins to exponentially decay. \n\nSo how do you interpret ranges? Legitimate day traders do not buy WITHIN the range. They wait for a breakout. If price breaks through the upper bound on significant volume, then a buy order is placed. Price is ridden up until volume and price show a rejection. \n\nGaps are also legitimate. We will likely hit .34 or lower by end of day before going back up.", "flair": {"text": "Technical ANALysis", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#9e8d49"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
