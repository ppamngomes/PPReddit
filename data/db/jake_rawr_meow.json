Dug even deeper into the text file and found something which could be tied to the FD disclosure...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/U4p9TSR.png\">A boolean tied to the dissemination of a pre-commencement tender offer.</a> </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, my theory is that an amended or subsequent 8K will be filed with the issuance of Pre-Commencement Tender Offer.  I have provided direct links to both 8K filings with the metadata below, maybe others can help me out with stuff I missed!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000119312523247428/0001193125-23-247428-index.htm\">Butterfly</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/278130/000156459020046418/0001564590-20-046418-index.htm\">Pier 1</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#94e044"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
