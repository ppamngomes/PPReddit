On that exact day we do not know, but from the S-1 from April 11th we know that <strong>the TSO as of April 10th was 558,735,983</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This value is more that the 4.5% calculated above, so as of April 10th the ~24M shares from HBC represented <strong>only 4.34% of the TSO</strong>. Assuming that after end of March the TSO only got bigger and that HBC did not increase their direct beneficial ownership, we can conclude that HBC has never been a substantial shareholder, at least until not touching their shares in abeyance, but we will come to that later on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much did HBC invest?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Initially they invested $ 225 million to buy the 23,685 Preferred Shares (PS) and receive the 84,216 Preferred Stock Warrants (PSW) and 95,387,533 Common Stock Warrants (CSW).</p>\n\n<p>Then the company forced the exercise of 5,000 PSW in February and 9,212 PSW in March, in total 14,212 PSW. Each PSW was converted into PS and HBC paid $ 9,500 for each, giving the company additional $ 135 million.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That means that HBC&#39;s total investment was ~$ 360 million!</strong> (and not only 225 as some were stating) </p>\n\n<p>From the shares in abeyance DD referenced above, we know that <strong>HBC could have held 311 million shares in abeyance.</strong></p>\n\n<p>What is then the total number of common stock shares that HBC could have? ~24 million in direct beneficial ownership + the 311 million shares held in abeyance, totaling <strong>335 million shares.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now, let&#39;s put that holding in perspective of the TSO. Let&#39;s assume the TSO of 782 million, our worst case.</p>\n\n<p>335 million out of 782 million is <strong>42,8% of the TSO!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you really think that HBC would simply lose $ 360 million and 42,8% of the company?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not impossible, but I don&#39;t believe that they would. They must have had a plan from the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now, we know that HBC as an institutional investor can hold up to 9.99%. However, the court was limiting the ownership at 4.5%. Assuming a TSO of 782 million, 4.5% is 35.19 million. Let&#39;s simplify to 35 million. This means that HBC could have held additional shares up to 35 million in direct beneficial ownership after April, during the Bankruptcy process, for example, not selling their CS converted from CSWs.</p>\n\n<p>So, HBC could have accumulated 35 million + 311 million = 346 million shares, or <strong>44.2% of a TSO</strong> of 782 million.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s further assume that HBC would request permission to the court and debtors to go over 4.5%, they could hold then up to 9.99% of the TSO. 9.99% of 782 is 77.41 million. 77 million to simplify.</p>\n\n<p>77 + 311 = 388 million or <strong>49,6% of the TSO</strong> of 782 million.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>WHAT COULD HAVE OCCURED OVER TIME</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Until petition date, April 23rd 2023</strong>: HBC holds 24 million shares in direct beneficial ownership and 311 shares in abeyance. 24/739 = 3,2% beneficial ownership</li>\n<li><strong>After petition date and around July 20th, when TSO is reported to be 782 million</strong>: HBC may have increased its direct beneficial ownership to hold up to 35 million shares, while keeping 311 million shares in abeyance. 35/782 = 4.48% beneficial ownership.</li>\n<li><strong>Until before Plan Consummation and share&#39;s being cancelled</strong>: HBC could have requested to go over 4.5%, up to 9.99%: 77/782 =  9,84% direct beneficial ownership.</li>\n<li><strong>After Plan Consummation and shares being cancelled</strong>: HBC could have requested shares held in abeyance to be finally counted as direct beneficial ownership: (77+311)/782 = <strong>49,6% direct beneficial ownership.</strong>  As by this time shares had already been cancelled and the board dissolved, there was no need to call for votes to allow someone to have more than 20% ownership by the business laws of New York. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>HBC is about to cause a Change of Control (CoC) or may have already caused one. </p>\n\n<p><strong>From this point onwards, we just surf on the same wave as HBC, or whoever HBC may have been acting as proxy to.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fact is, <strong>HBC invested $ 360 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Add on top of this all the evidence identified by <a href=\"/u/jake2b\">u/jake2b</a> <strong>on the Section 16(b), pointing out that HBC could not have sold their shares and that the company was talking to a single shareholder.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Either HBC lost it all or they will come out on top.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, whatever happens to HBC will happen to us too.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83e\udda7 War Ape \ud83e\udda7", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xpSNCfwb6f6zOTyerGtA0NHRkfRpxh5dZuI52oLPRps.jpg\"/></div>"},

I cannot understand why someone would not make an alterate optional conversion of those CSWs and get 65% of that number as CS, or 802,550 CS. That would be a significant number of shares, and let us remember that there was plenty of time to sell those shares in the open market, as the shares were trading for a long time since May 5th.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that CSWs could not have been redeemed as the PS, with a 15% premium due to bankruptcy. The redeem option was only available for Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (PS)</p>\n\n<p>Why would anyone hold them until cancellation?</p>\n\n<p>The only reason I can think of is that Hudson Bay Capital (HBC), who can hold up to 9.99% shares and not report until mid February 2024 (please check <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/16d0w8z/held_in_abeyance_you_say_how_hudson_bay_capital/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/16d0w8z/held_in_abeyance_you_say_how_hudson_bay_capital/</a>), would be already holding that 9.99% limit.

Well, I don&#39;t know about the exact mechanism and loopholes that could enable that, <strong>but if they would exist I do know that the Bankruptcy Process could not prevent that from happening if those two things would be confirmed as not property of the State.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this approach is that there is no need to pay class 6 in full, the around $ 1 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine that this new equity could be outside of the DTC reach and in a decentralized exchange.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>My intent is not to fully go over all aspects and implications of this, but instead just to throw this idea here to all to see how it initially resonates.</p>\n\n<p>If oyu ask me about the NOLS, I would say they are not so important as getting over the restrictions of the Absolute Priority Rule.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So, &quot;there you have it&quot;, a bull thesis that stands on the assumption that the Second Amended Chapter 11 Plan will be followed exactly like the bear shills state it will.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83e\udda7 War Ape \ud83e\udda7", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Consequently, the further acceptance or rejection of the Plan was solicited on a wrong basis, in violation of section 1125(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. This in turn harmed the Movants by preventing them to file timely objections, which furthermore led to the Final Approval of the Disclosure Statement based on erroneous basis. </p>\n\n<p><strong>(iv) its Certification will materially advance the progress of the case</strong></p>\n\n<p>-&gt; they claim that there are many judicial efficiency reasons.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The Movants believe that all 4 factors are present and therefore request the Court to certify a direct appeal to the Third Circuit.</p>\n\n<p>The ball is now with Honorable Papalia, to grant or deny it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> <strong>Motion-2: EMERGENCY MOTION TO STOP THE PROCESS, PROHIBIT AND REVERT SHARES CANCELLATION</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>With this motion the Movants request the Bankruptcy Court to </p>\n\n<p>(i) entry of an order to stay pending appeal the court&#39;s order confirming the Second Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan (docket 2160) and the court order for the &quot;Final Approval And Confirmation Order&quot; (docket 2172). <strong>In other words: to put the whole process on hold, including Plan Confirmation and Final Approval and Confirmation Order.</strong></p>\n\n<p>and by an injunction, </p>\n\n<p>(ii) immediately prohibit the Debtors, the Transfer Agent and the SEC from cancelling, releasing, extinguishing, terminating registration of or restricting shareholder access to their shares or information related to theirs shares. Moreover, the Movants request also that any actions that might have been already taken to that effect be reverted. <strong>In other words: stop the fuckery they believe is happening with our shares.</strong></p>\n\n<p>They present evidence contained in their &quot;Das Affidavit&quot; that the Debtors have already started cancelling stockholder&#39;s shares and/or manipulating shareholder records and changing transfer agent.</p>\n\n<p>The Movants claim that they would suffer irreparable harm if stockholder&#39;s shares are cancelled, released, extinguished or their registration is terminated before all the shares are turned over, persuant to sections 542 and 541 of the Bankruptcy Code. They also claim they would also suffer<br/>\n irreparable harm if estate assets are distributed in accordance to the Confirmation Order prior to the determination of their appeal, because they claim that the appeal would be then challenged as equitably moot. <strong>In simpler words: shorts would win again over retail if no share callback is done before cancellation and if the fuckery is not stopped now, it will be impossible to revert it later.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To justify their motion, the Movants rely on the Bankruptcy Rule 8007.</p>\n\n<p>A stay pending appeal persuant to Rule 8007 should be granted based on the following factors:</p>\n\n<p><strong>(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that it is likely to succees on the merits</strong></p>\n\n<p>-&gt; they believe they are likely to succeed based on their argumentation</p>\n\n<p><strong>(2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured if a stay is not granted</strong></p>\n\n<p>-&gt; they argument that yes, see paragraph above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding</strong></p>\n\n<p>-&gt; they believe the other parties will not be harmed, or only suffer minimal harm in relation to the harm that the stockholders would suffer in case the stay is not granted. </p>\n\n<p><strong>(4) where there is public interest</strong></p>\n\n<p>-&gt; they reference the argumentation of the Motion-1related to public interest and the potential to set a precedent.</p>\n\n<p>The Movants cite some precedence that the four factors should be balanced.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, they claim that all four factors are present and that therefore they respectfully request the Court to grant the relief requested.</p>\n\n<p>This ball is now also with Honorable Papalia, to grant or deny it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "\ud83e\udda7 War Ape \ud83e\udda7", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

This is the same info as in the Ammended Plan from Docket 1712.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t6d5jfbmrujb1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=cace41669707605c70509de50232bf2987deab94\n\nExhibit 2 is important, because there we have the confliciting information, we will come back to it later on.\n\nLet's continue to see what else is being ordered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hm0b8fsmuujb1.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfa41eb7593c09b7f1a15580af7b30acd89f6700\n\nAgain Exhibit 2, they approved its publication with the conflicting information.\n\nLet's proceed, what else was approved with Docket 1716:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bkjqegyrpujb1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f1477660f4b2ace092829ac41fb17e21796665f\n\nOk, Exhibit 7 is what will be actually sent on the Plan Supplement Filing Deadline. \n\nHere it is:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qawh1iqsujb1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=672a41a0977771bcc54a4abbcb2357c4209dfffe\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45rvz5srsujb1.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3a7cbe8193af4fa2a2d08a821923ca500cd12a7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6uvqc7ftsujb1.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=c24b20bc4595be56e4dd614fc369febed9601483\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xupm9ipusujb1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=953558ea08bd5ae620ba8fce39977f1bf87ac4bf\n\nOk, Exhibit 7 does not have the conflicting info and is what will be published on the Plan Supplement Deadline.\n\nNow let's come back to Exhibit 2, the one with the conflicting information.\n\nHere it is:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgj6zvl5tujb1.png?width=746&format=png&auto=webp&s=9804f6837aae23ebcd9824b91d5887486e1dfb7c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i9hnaxw6tujb1.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e38e62a0b2f34c6534e67efba5d07c5121649b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4a72ng18tujb1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e54287ced3bbba04d5f6bcbb7b3644ebd0733b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k7usoj29tujb1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fe0e2fe77be0f90a72bdf653865776db7774546\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7lnp2lbatujb1.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf82e3edfd6c32611a0a20acd4fd57bd5f95ed33\n\nSo, the conflicting information on the deadline for the Plan Supplement is only present here, at the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION part of Exhibit 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In my understanding, the ammended PLAN (Docket 1712) (table and definition of the Plan Supplement containing the deadline) and the DISCLOSURE STATEMENT (Docket 1713) take precedence over Exhibit 2 as part of Docket 1716, which is more like a side note on the \"additional information\" part of it. The same Docket 1716 has also the table with the same info as in Dockets 1712 and 1713.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The deadline should have been no later than 14 days prior to the Voting Deadline (Sept 1st), so August 18th, last Friday. They missed it!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OPEN QUESTIONS and SPECULATION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe question now is if this is a big deal or not. Can they simply issue it and keep the Voting Deadline or will they need to shift it?\n\nWhy did they miss the deadline? If the ammended Plan from August 1st would be the final plan, it should be an easy thing and they should just publish it, right?\n\nWhat can be happening?\n\n&#x200B;", "flair": {"text": "\ud83e\udda7 War Ape \ud83e\udda7", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NBUWjowBaH8iVjtK3LjIDjh0RE4R9CXbHxHQINECNxU.jpg\"/></div>"},
