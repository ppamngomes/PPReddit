The paper hands have been burned away and will stay out of the way next time or have been trained into Diamond hands if RC lands the second turnaround.  \n\nI like the turnaround play, I love the rebalancing the playing field play. Hopefully it is a two-fer. \n\nEither way\u2026I\u2019m holding and buying every paycheck. I have wrecked my portfolio balance since Jan. 23, but I haven\u2019t invested more than I can lose.
