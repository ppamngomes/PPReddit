A genuinely well-aimed fling at the PP Bull Thesis.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, for those fellow PPs ready to throw a tomato at me after reading the above, I disagree with its overall thesis regarding BBBY and its lovable, degenerate PP devotees, yet let us give credit where credit is due. </p>\n\n<p>Let us *savor* the \u201chit\u201d and learn from it what we can. </p>\n\n<p>The piece by Tony Dong, appearing on LinkedIn, is well-written and has enough elements of truth in it to wound a PP in an insecure frame of mind. </p>\n\n<p>The article makes some good general points about the modern stock market, in particular, how few stocks outperform the overall market long-term and how hard they are to identify prior to that happy event. The bald fact being that in today\u2019s markets, most people would be better off just buying index funds so as to catch the few outliers that do out-perform without having to guess which ones will do so in the future. I would argue this situation is due partially to inherent properties of markets yet amplified due to our current markets being heavily shaped by a \u201ccorruption/control matrix\u201d (*See?* I\u2019m a real-deal PP cultist!), but that\u2019s another subject. </p>\n\n<p>The article is correct on a central point \u2013 that Social Media lends itself well to the sharing of complex information, enabling the formation of a \u201chive mind\u201d regarding a narrow subject, yet that hive mind itself, once its gains momentum, can end up being little more than an \u201cecho chamber\u201d stuffed with confirmation bias, and in the end lead its members down a primrose path to a complete loss. A sober perusal of the wreckage of many stock and crypto Sub-Reddits past make this assertion irrefutable.  </p>\n\n<p>IMHO, this ability of a hive mind to be fooled by selective information has been weaponized/hi-jacked by scammers and perhaps even by sophisticated yet corrupt financial institutions (I have no evidence I am aware of to date, only my suspicions \u2013 perhaps the unfolding FTX Scandal has already or will generate that evidence) to fleece Retail Investors. </p>\n\n<p>Granting Mr. Dong his general points of truth, the key question from our point of view is: is the PP Show YT channel and Sub-Reddit such a failed hive mind, and thus worthy of his Cargo Cult analogy?</p>\n\n<p>Let us grant Mr. Dong another several points of respect: </p>\n\n<p>we could easily be such an echo chamber, especially to casual observation;</p>\n\n<p>he is absolutely correct that we look absurd to the casual outside observer (and incredible props to Bill Pulte for holding our hands publicly during this period \u2013 think of his sober mid-western Rich Residential Property Bros\u2019 opinions of his behavior \u2013 if he is wrong in the end, he will never live it down in that circle, and that circle matters to his core HVAC business);</p>\n\n<p>a *bunch* of the assertions made on the PP Show YT/Sub-Reddit *will* turn out to be most assuredly, most absurdly incorrect, with many being quickly forgotten or becoming sources of mirth going forward. And that\u2019s OK \u2013 anyone who has lived through a war could tell you of the endless false rumors and theories that fly around in trenches \u2013 thus is the Fog of War.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s not let our disagreement with Mr. Dong\u2019s specific thesis that we are a delusional echo chamber of zeroed-out Baggies perturb some of our greatest strengths as PPs: </p>\n\n<p>we acknowledge at all times that we could be wrong and thus this is a true, and if we are correct in our more ambitious hopes, the greatest ever, \u201cZero or Hero\u201d play;</p>\n\n<p>as we stubbornly piled in while BBBY descended into BK and disappearance from our accounts, no one nowshould have a dime in this high/risk high reward play that they haven\u2019t already kissed goodbye with the blessing;</p>\n\n<p>and ultimately, PPs have been able to laugh at themselves throughout this entire journey \u2013 many self-mocking memes are welcomed and upvoted on the Sub and I think that\u2019s great \u2013 it is one of my points of pride as a PP.</p>\n\n<p>Let us turn now to Mr. Dong\u2019s specific thesis regarding BBBY being a dead play and thus that the PP Show YT/Sub are one of the worst, most delusional modern financial echo chambers.</p>\n\n<p>Without getting into too many details of an incredibly complex BK, there are two points that make Mr. Dong\u2019s diagnosis premature:</p>\n\n<p>as Travis has argued this past week in his excellent post-op of Jake\u2019s gloriously funny destruction of the Platinum Person in live debate, that there are over 300 completely redacted dockets and hundreds of dockets that are partially redacted, an unusual amount, as well as an unusual amount of NDAs flying around this BK process. Therefore, our PP Bullish thesis cannot be falsified until the Judge\u2019s final decree;</p>\n\n<p>a *careful* reading of the dockets makes it clear that we are heading out of Chapter 11 BK with a goal of NOL preservation, NOL preservation requires Class A Common Stockholders to receive compensation, that compensation will be cash, equity or both. That in the case of cash, the vast majority of BBBYQ holders will be deeply green, and that if equity is involved, they will do very well indeed as any major company returning from liquidation pricing to a major market will experience violent upwards price action.   </p>\n\n<p>Is Mr. Dong correct or are PPs correct?</p>\n\n<p>The truth is the adage: no one who knows is talking and anyone talking doesn\u2019t know. </p>\n\n<p>As an end note, I will praise Mr. Dong\u2019s piece again: it is a weapons grade hit piece. 10 out 10. For fun, I grade shills/Melturds (I am not accusing Mr. Dong of being one) appearing on the PP Sub all the time and none have come close to this gem. </p>\n\n<p>The true beauty of the piece is that it is not falsifiable without detailed knowledge of the BK, something the vast majority of readers of his article surely will not have, and thus is utterly convincing to his target audience. Please don\u2019t show it to my wife!!! </p>\n\n<p>So PPs are back at Square One. The BBBYQ play is out of our hands, we await our fate with equanimity and retain the ability to laugh at ourselves, calm in the knowledge we have taken great risks in order to possibly earn great rewards. If this play goes in our favor, whatever anyone says to us about \u201cbeing lucky\u201d, we should know we earned our success. I, for one, will print out and frame the article. </p>\n\n<p>I am immensely proud to be part of this community and will have zero regrets whatever the outcome.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Wouldn&#39;t it look exactly the same?</p>\n\n<p>Call me cynical, but to me the biggest indicator that this <em>isn&#39;t</em> happening is just that we&#39;ve literally not had a single piece of good news since I got into this play save for that squeeze in July-Aug &#39;22.

A miserable, disheartening slog the whole long-ass multi-year journey until Yorktown.</p>\n\n<p>While a retail nobody like myself can&#39;t sit here and realistically say &quot;100% common shareholders will be compensated&quot; without it being at least in part mere bravado, </p>\n\n<p>...every step we have taken still leaves that door open. </p>\n\n<p>And we have taken a <em>lot</em> of steps. </p>\n\n<p>Without exhausting a long list of events, the <em>single</em> biggest indicator for me, is the significant monies approved by the Fed BK judge in this high profile case towards NOL Preservation. </p>\n\n<p>NOL Preservation requires common shareholder compensation.</p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t heard even a <em>single</em> peep out of a bear/shill/meltie, even the most ignorant and aggressively toxic (I&#39;m sure one will come along now, LOL, good ol&#39; shills, so predictable...), that that statement is not accurate.</p>\n\n<p>To me, <em>no way</em> the judge approved those significant expenses towards NOL Preservation unless he determined that the BK was obviously moving in that direction. </p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, he&#39;s hanging himself out to dry. Why would a Fed BK judge make such a &quot;own goal&quot; faux pas? </p>\n\n<p>Even if one had a cynical frame of mind and said &quot;he&#39;s bribed&quot;, then if so - by whom?

The Consumer or store worker would use a Teddy app to make the scan. Consumer pays there (or later as noted below). \u201cAffiiliate\u201d store gets its cut.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Consumer decides delivery to store for pickup or to home.</p></li>\n<li><p>When the Consumer scans an item at a store, if they purchase it later, the Affiliate *still gets* some cut of the revenue, perhaps the cut is higher if within 48 hours, for example, and then lowers over time. This allows stores to profit from the &quot;store shop then buy online&quot; style of shopping. Now shops *want* to be the place Consumers \u201clooky-loo\u201d for future online purchases \u2013 everyone wins.</p></li>\n<li><p>This eCommerce model allows even a street vendor to make trusted sales with very little inventory. Little stores could benefit and the model is scalable to sections within larger stores.</p></li>\n<li><p>Teddy becomes a multi-tentacled beast with display space literally everywhere. Inventory backend is very efficient, small store Affiliates have far less risk of dead inventory \u2013 simply sell off the display items when no longer relevant.</p></li>\n<li><p>Small niche store Affiliates could specialize in searching for niche products to display (like \u201cGoth Cosplay apparel\u201d or \u201cGamer PC components\u201d), including those on discount within the Teddy marketplace, bringing additional value to their customers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Returns could be designated as Affiliate store provided or Teddy provided (perhaps if Affiliate provided the Affiliate would receive a little higher cut on the sale).</p></li>\n<li><p>With this model, a Consumer on vacation, for example, could buy items, then trust they would be delivered and also returned if necessary.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

It\u2019s a legitimate question.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Here is my response:</p>\n\n<p>Glad you asked!</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I\u2019m not bright enough to offer DD, not sublime enough to produce great meme reels, yet want to contribute to this wonderful community in some way, so I\u2019m an aspiring Unlicensed Concern Karen, running foot loose and fancy free until swatted down by the Mods, and my services are worth every penny you are paying for them.</p></li>\n<li><p>Whether you acknowledge it or not, IMHO, and the opinion it seems of many people who actually make the Sub tick, the Sub is under more or less constant pressure from Short-funded shills. </p></li>\n<li><p>While I make mistakes, especially in the moment, I feel my record is better when sitting back and observing over time. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In my own mind, I\u2019ve hit it out of the park a few times, my deciphering of the \u201cTurd in the Salad\u201d being the one I\u2019m most proud of. My amateur Neuroscience background and rudimentary understanding of hypnosis being the way I was able to put my finger on that weapons-grade bit of Shillery. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cDiscovering\u201d that was fun, so I try to watch out for more of this insanity. So here I am, a Red-bulled-up Mall Cop with a fully-charged Segway. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Over time, you seem to have produced a pretty consistent string of what I would term \u201cSubtle Shill\u201d postings/commentary of a vaguely negative and \u201csubversive\u201d nature. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>***********</p>\n\n<p>So let\u2019s take a deep dive into my personal flavor of paranoia as it applies to your posting, shall we?</p>\n\n<p>(Notes: the OP\u2019s posting had the recent RC tweet meme of an \u201cold\u201d version of himself as an image at the top, Op\u2019s text is broken up in quotations in the bullet points below.

An actual newbie does not speak like this. Amateur melters do not sound like this. Nope, I smell all that is left over - a Real Deal Pro Shill.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\u201cI hope that is the case, however I have had an intrusive thought come up after seeing a tweet from Ryan Cohen as a old mf dude. When I first saw it I tried to look for whatever I could to look for an extra meaning because RC said in the interview that all details are important.\u201d </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>More of same, softening the reader\u2019s critical faculties up with \u201cintrusive thought\u201d and \u201cextra meaning\u201d and appealing to the PP mindset of trying to peer behind the veil - a necessary mindset to have in order to have hung around for 84 years, yet here, perhaps, is being turned against itself in order to subvert the thought processes of unsuspecting PPs. </p>\n\n<p>I also note the leaning on a generic statement by RC as an appeal to credibility \u2013 getting you to nod your head, \u201cYes\u201d, in order to soften you up for the non-sensical leaps of \u201clogic\u201d to follow. Even car sales reps use this technique.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\u201cI guess my question is What could this mean? Could this be his way of distancing or letting us know that he is not part of \u201conly the young\u201d? </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And here is the leap, the payload! </p>\n\n<p>*OOOooooh NOOOOoooos!* We were wrong all this time \u2013 we have been abandoned!! </p>\n\n<p>(Christians, please forgive a bit of blasphemy)</p>\n\n<p>\u2018Eloi Eloi Lama Sabachthani\u2019!</p>\n\n<p>This is taking advantage of the necessary vagueness of the tin foil suffusing this play as all *kinds* of interpretations can be spun.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not saying this payload is all that devastating, that convincing.

I\u2019m convinced we all have suffered due to the immense damage done by the \u201cDestroy for Profits\u201d WS \u201cMatrix\u201d that is cellar boxing.</p>\n\n<p>With a MOASS, these Rum-soaked, Dildo-slapping, Diamond-handed, Financial Evil Studies PhD-educated, Filthy Rich and Mo-Fooking PISSED PPs (and other Apes that benefit from the breaking of the basket) make bank while it is happening and afterwards survive and thrive to, brick-by-brick, build a foundation for a better future.</p>\n\n<p>Though PPs (and shortly thereafter Apes) will profit insanely as this process unfolds...</p>\n\n<p>Yay, Tendies!</p>\n\n<p>...this process basically &quot;breaks money&quot; via a hyperinflationary fiat currency collapse at some point. </p>\n\n<p>An example, of which the rumblings are already being heard, of how this could happen: panicked and incompetent (due to the indolent cocoon of the current system which benefits them so lopsidedly) Pols, Treasury/DTC/SEC Bros and Bro-ettes, desperately seeking to backstop their future plum semi-retirements positions, speaking fees, campaign contributions, etc. (or perhaps answering the demands of their Blackmailers...oh yeah, some of that going on) pour money after money into the Hedgies, Market Makers, Banks, Pension Funds, Insurance Funds or whatever other cog in the money machine is collapsing that moment.</p>\n\n<p>In the end stages of these doomed attempts to prop up the system for One More Day, the hyper-inflation Doom Loop begins. Even MOASS-level money disappears Weimar Germany/Zimbabwe-style in the end stages. As Voltaire said: (in the end) \u201call paper currency returns to its intrinsic value\u201d, intrinsic value here meaning the value of the paper it was printed on, or, in our modern case, a cloud of electrons just evaporates.</p>\n\n<p>Bummer!</p>\n\n<p>However, our Band of Intrepid PPs (Apes will do well or not depending on their plays, some may be in the Teddy play with us, some not), because of the Deep F-ing Value of the Teddy Play, their shares &quot;appear&quot; again on &quot;the other side&quot; of this Fiat Collapse and price discovery renews. </p>\n\n<p>Actually, everything else appears again on the other side as well, yet there will be a massive \u201cvalue reckoning&quot; as a new economy arises from the ashes, a reckoning in which the PPs will do well indeed, anchored by the Rock of DFV that is Teddy.</p>\n\n<p>To me, this is how far ahead people like RC, the Icahns and Pulte are thinking and how PPs become useful allies in the coming new dawn. </p>\n\n<p>Even More Speculative Speculation:</p>\n\n<p>This may be part of the reason for RC/Pulte&#39;s push for DRS - as a great way to encourage long-term ownership beyond the fiat collapse. </p>\n\n<p>Can you imagine hyper-inflation conditions, massive confusion and suffering along with obvious signs and speculation that &quot;all money will soon disappear&quot;? </p>\n\n<p>The mindfook that would be the potential of our &quot;Hodl! Hodl&quot; crazy phone number tendies evaporating along with all other dollars? </p>\n\n<p>Ask a Zimbabwean who lived through it how awesome it was to have phone book number-denominated currency notes in their wallet \u2013 they existed very recently \u2013 in the billions each. Yeah, that was great and worked out well\u2026not.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the value of DRS may really be mostly as a way to encourage us to hold our shares long-term \u2013 to hold them past the collapse of our current fiat system until a new system arises, whatever it may be.</p>\n\n<p>DRS could have value beyond that, perhaps be as a more trustworthy record keeper of share ownership then many of our brokers, as many will inevitably melt down and close shop in the midst of such a financial storm.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry, folks, this is best I could come up with \u2013 Infinity Pools just make my PeaPea-sized brain hurt.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Those that roll their eyes at this posting, I understand, it&#39;s worse than tin foil, it&#39;s political tin foil and my apologies as well on that note for those on the other side of the spectrum. This is a benevolent-dictator-run semi-free speech platform, let the Mods decide if it belongs. </p>\n\n<p>On the Aug 28th show, last night, Plur went on for a minute or two about Pulte putting out a bunch of &quot;17&quot;s. </p>\n\n<p>Within the &quot;Q&quot; movement, the number 17 represents the letter &quot;Q&quot; and thus Q itself. Q self-purports to be a team of Mil Intel/,former Mil Intel that formed in the aftermath of the Reagan admin, plotting and biding its time, then working closely with Trump while he was in office with the shared goal of fighting a world-straddling evil conspiracy termed &quot;Cabal&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Q referred to Wall Street as a pillar of Cabal&#39;s financial control, picking winners and losers, weakening the economy, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Q referred loosely to &quot;White Hats&quot; (like-minded/cooperating with the Q team) and &quot;Black Hats&quot; (naughty people working in some capacity for Cabal) - the general message being that people at this WhiteHat/Black Hat level being aware at some level they were on &quot;a team&quot; and coordinating, at least loosely. </p>\n\n<p>The Q team posted about &quot;17&quot; being a somewhat of, for lack of a better word, open comms &quot;dog whistle&quot; often used by the White Hats (though sometimes mentioned as used by Cabal as a kind of &quot;stick it to them&quot; counter (think Spy vs Spy forest of mirrors). </p>\n\n<p>Steeped in Q tin foil, I have observed a narrative thread of Patrick Byrne (someone close to Trump. Yes, he is goofy at times, yet he is undoubtedly on the side of retail) influencing RC, RC having a thread of bring non-political in many ways, yet drawing the line on occasion in a way more in line with what many people would consider on the Conservative spectrum (an anti-vax tweet, etc.). </p>\n\n<p>Pulte is close to RC. These guys are on the side of retail and endure a lot of MSM FUD and struggle against WS, both of which Q considers Cabal-comped. </p>\n\n<p>Engineering the MOASS would be important to the Q narrative of a &quot;Great Awakening&quot; among the masses. The Q team are not financial wizards/titans, but would gleefully recruit and support enough of same to trigger MOASS.  </p>\n\n<p>An army of filthy rich Apes and Degenerate, Drug Using, Gambling, Society Destroyers hardened in the fire of opposition to what can fairly be described as a financial &quot;matrix&quot; of control and corruption would be invaluable to creating a better world in the aftermath of a Cabal overthrow. </p>\n\n<p>I also note, a ton of people who would be utterly &quot;un-Redpillable&quot; via a political angle, could be awakened to the corrupt matrix of control via a Frontline fight with the financial tentacles of Cabal  up close and personal, hodling for riches which they are very likely to use for good after seeing so much evil up close.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a glue-huffing Q-bert. 17 is known as an open comm dog whistle usually employed by White Hats in cahoots with the Q team. IMHO, I&#39;ve been watching Pulte and RC acting all along as if they were White Hats. I&#39;m not the least surprised by Pulte blowing 17s out there like a boss and look forward to whatever is coming.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
