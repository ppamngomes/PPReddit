It\u2019s weird as fuck that the company keeps releasing shitty news when we are low on volume. Now that the RC case has been dropped could it have been that it was a way for the company to help stall the plans and keep the momentum going? I mean while they were waiting for the RC case to be dismissed was staying on REGSHO a tactic? I genuinely wouldn\u2019t be shocked if we hear something soon (I\u2019ll be fucking relieved, that\u2019s for sure) but I won\u2019t be shocked because it would be on par with all the speculation this whole ass ride.", "flair": {"text": "", "text_color": "", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
