He said anyone can go straight to the OCC  (Options Clearing Corporation) and check this information, but went ahead and checked for me while still on the phone. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;As of right now all Calls are essentially Worthless, and Long Puts will be receiving full value. (Strike price x 100). Anyone short on puts will have to pay in full.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>As of October 20th though ALL OPTIONS will expire worthless, excluding the upcoming weeks expiration dates (This Friday and next. 6th and 13th respectively).  </p>\n\n<p>I also asked about the rumors of Shwab on Monday telling people about the preliminary $25 cash buyout and dude said &quot;I was actually out Monday but I feel like I would have heard something about that&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>This entire convo was 6 minutes.
