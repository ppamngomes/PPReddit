Goldberg</a>: <em>...Michael Goldberg chairs Akerman\u2019s Fraud and Recovery Practice, an experienced team of lawyers focused on unraveling high-profile investor fraud, including Ponzi schemes... Michael has managed some of the largest Ponzi scheme liquidation recoveries in U.S. history. As a qualified expert witness on the topic, he is highly sought after and routinely testifies in federal and state court cases throughout the country and internationally.</em></p>\n\n<p>About <a href=\"https://www.ifrahlaw.com/attorneys/george-r-calhoun/\">George R. Calhoun</a>: <em>George\u2019s practice primarily focuses on the litigation of complex disputes for clients in a broad array of disciplines, including contracts, cryptocurrency, securities, bankruptcy, fraud, RICO and other business claims. He has an extensive background in dispute resolution, having appeared before numerous state and federal courts on behalf of clients including large multi-national corporations, insurers, and individuals. ... In addition, George represents a major U.S. company in collecting a multi-billion judgment, having assisted in the recovery of over $1.2 billion through a determined international effort spanning over a dozen countries.</em></p>\n\n<p>Calhoun seems to be a big player and it&#39;s quite interesting that he is being introduced so late in the game. I&#39;m wondering if there is a possibility that they are requesting the names of individuals who have shares registered in street name via brokerage, as part of an ongoing RICO investigation. </p>\n\n<p>This would have the potential of painting a clearer picture: on one side we know exactly how many registered shares exist per AST, on the other side we could find out how many naked short positions exist in brokerages (albeit just a snapshot in time).</p>\n\n<p>This whole saga will expose financial crime far beyond Bed Bath alone, and I have a feeling that this master plan they have conceived will ensure that <strong>every</strong> holder gets paid, and that this time around there will be jail time for all nefarious actors involved.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
