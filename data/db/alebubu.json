Welp, I may have an answer for you. It\u2019s still speculation, but the evidence is stacking up. </p>\n\n<p>Key details</p>\n\n<p>Icahn posts 65% of his 84% total stake up for collateral, for \u201cunspecified margin loan\u201d</p>\n\n<p>65% of his 84% = $6.44B at $33.37/share</p>\n\n<p>The news of this margin loan DOES NOT come from IEP or Icahn himself. It originates with Hindenburg, and they knew before their announcement/declaration of war on IEP/Icahn. This changes things in my eyes. I thought it was possible Hindenburg timed and executed this \u201chit\u201d to prevent a big move from IEP. But now that we know the origins of this news\u2026 I think it\u2019s likely, if not certain. Before this revelation, the loan made sense as a war chest to combat the increased short pressure. But as I said, Hindenburg knew of the loan before they even announced anything. The loan, THE BIG $6.44B LOAN has to be for something else. </p>\n\n<p>This would explain so much. Why the attack started when the fat $2.00/share divi was still up in the air. Why they\u2019re even attacking a valued dividend company in the first place. Why the allegations are so weak, compared to other Hindenburg plays. This is far from a home run play\u2026 because this is Hindenburg acting as some interested parties attack dog. Someone wants IEP/Icahn crippled. At least temporarily. </p>\n\n<p>We still don\u2019t know exactly what the collateralized loan is for, but we can speculate. And I choose to speculate it is for BBBY. </p>\n\n<p>BBBYQ</p>\n\n<p>BBBY themselves, at the preliminary Ch. 11 hearing said they could secure a buyer in ~8 days. Ironically, this also matches up with Hindenburgs short attack. Someone probably has loose lips in whichever financing office IEP/Icahn uses. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not the strongest numbers guy, but if someone could link me to credible sites that provide free financial data, I will crunch some numbers after work. Stuff like debt obligations, Ch.11 costs, bond prices, secured/unsecured, leasing etc etc.</p>\n\n<p>This is more or less all I got at the moment, but I don\u2019t want to leave you all with less momentum, so here\u2019s some other bullish stuff I\u2019ve come across. </p>\n\n<p>10yr bonds are trading at $3.80\n20yr bonds are trading at $3.50</p>\n\n<p>A potential buyer can scoop up bonds, cheap af.. \u2018forgive\u2019 the debt and subtract that total cost from the cost of the purchase. More or less a 20%-30% off bed bath coupon. </p>\n\n<p>Pure tinfoil - Icahn\u2019s $6.44B loan may be leveraged. Not enough info yet, but if it is holy fuck would he be hard to beat in a bidding war. </p>\n\n<p>This is just a fresh out the gate theory for me. If anyone has more, please run with it!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bnn.network/breaking-news/short-seller-hindenburg-research-targets-carl-icahns-iep-bonds-citing-unresolved-issues/amp/\">https://bnn.network/breaking-news/short-seller-hindenburg-research-targets-carl-icahns-iep-bonds-citing-unresolved-issues/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/04/24/bed-bath-beyond-close-stores-coupons-membership/amp/\">https://fortune.com/2023/04/24/bed-bath-beyond-close-stores-coupons-membership/amp/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Just as an example.. if this LBO was offered from a private equity firm, it is very likely a good thing JPM and/or 6th Street blocked it.</p>\n\n<p>If someone has the answer, that would be great, otherwise I\u2019ll be digging through filings all night. I\u2019ll try to have a post up my tomorrow afternoon, but I\u2019m a regarded monkey.. so it\u2019s slow going. </p>\n\n<p>Also, IEP and Icahn will have a small section. The nonsense I was stating on the show last night was incorrect\u2026 I was wrong about the advance notice of a dividend. The SEC/exchanges require a notice of a week before the record date of a dividend, and not a single day. However! The announcement IEP released yesterday was just an \u201cintention to declare a dividend\u201d. The declaration date has not happened yet\u2026 so IEP/Icahn still have wiggle room to push out the dividend Ex/EFF date out further.. to prevent investors from selling during this Hindenburg short attack. </p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a quote directly from IEP:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe would normally wait for the earnings call but, due to the many inquiries we have received, we are announcing now our intention to declare a distribution in the amount of $2.00 per depositary unit for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, with the election to receive either cash or additional depositary units.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>March 31, 2023 is just the end of their quarter, not the cutoff date to receive the dividend. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading, I really hope someone can help me out with this LBO inquiry.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
