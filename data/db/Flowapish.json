PP show rocks and all the dd is just epic. It kept me hooked and gave me unwavering conviction about my investment.</p>\n\n<p>I read and heard many people that moving to a decentralised T0 exchange would be great as the market would be fairer and that HF would be less able to manipulate the price.</p>\n\n<p>When I look at cryptos in the last year and also my dear LRC tokens that I bought, how crazy it was slammed down and it seems it doesn&#39;t matter how many people buy, the price won&#39;t move. As if supply/demand was not working either. It seems its as manipulated as normal stocks, or maybe a bit less.</p>\n\n<p>My question to you is, what makes you believe that they couldn&#39;t just manipulate the new issued tokenized securities just as they are doing with cryptos?</p>\n\n<p>Anyone got any dd to read about that or could point out a few &quot;proofs&quot; that demonstrate the crypto market does actually work better and that supply &amp; demand is real as it should be and how everyone whishes it would be?</p>\n\n<p>I got 24k shares and I am fully invested in GME as well. Really hope we get positive news soon at that we finally make a step in the right direction to fight these corrupt SHF.</p>\n\n<p>Love you all and take care, may we get positive news soon!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
