Naked short selling is the practice of selling shares that the seller does not actually own or have borrowed, which is illegal under U.S. securities laws.\n\nIf a stock undergoes a reverse split and a new CUSIP number is assigned, any naked short positions on the stock will be adjusted to reflect the new number of shares and new CUSIP number. This means that the short seller will need to buy back the adjusted number of shares at the new price to cover their position, just as they would with a regular short sale.\n\nIt's important to note that naked short selling is illegal, and investors should not engage in this practice. If you believe that a stock is being manipulated through naked short selling, you can report this to the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).", "flair": {"text": "", "text_color": "", "back_color": ""}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
