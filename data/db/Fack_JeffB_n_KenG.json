Anyone needs work, there are thousands of openings in healthcare.

I know it\u2019s tough out there for a lot of fields (software dev being one). I work in Healthcare IT. I am happy to help you navigate the job search. Decent pay in this space.  It depends on experience, but you can make $80k-$130k+ per year. Across the nation, there are thousands of vacancy. We need these roles to be able to run the health information technology at our hospitals and clinics. I don\u2019t need any personal information, but if you\u2019d like to know what to search for, I am happy to help you understand what the posted opening might be actually doing (there\u2019s tons of ambiguity in the actual responsibilities and titles). I can also help you tweak your resume (I can give general advice if you don\u2019t want to share any personal details). I\u2019m here to help! I\u2019m not heavily invested in BBBY (just a lotto ticket so I can retire and spend more time with family and friends). I\u2019m offering because no one deserves to get ghosted by employers and there are tons of openings everywhere in this space: Many people just don\u2019t know what to look for and how to be more marketable.  I will delete this post after a few days because I don\u2019t want too much personal information out there. Feel free to PM me or just ask in the comments!
