Let's take a look!", "text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As stated in the chart title, I have been looking at different sets of macroeconomic data and seeing if I can find any correlations to stock price action.  As I expected, there are a couple weird things that happened at specific dates that the media has been telling us something entirely different.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This post will be a little bit scatterbrained because I want to show three separate incidents where we were told one thing, but the macroeconomic trends say something else.</p>\n\n<p>BBBY, Terra/Luna, and GME/FTX</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start with BBBY, since this is a BBBY sub after all.</p>\n\n<p>As I am sure everyone remembers, a lot of crazy stuff happened in August 2022, including wild stories like the CFO jumping to his death, a CGI college student making $100 million betting on GME, and Ryan Cohen selling the stock.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed that at the exact same time BBBY spiked, Earning remittances due to the US Treasury started tanking.  This has never happened before.  Ever.  Since then, the remittances have been falling of a cliff and are now -100 Billion in the hole.</p>\n\n<p>Is correlation causation? No... but it is a very weird correlation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z5p62n1da1qb1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28660fb94b55fd62a53693597a8da214dd91d47b\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/z5p62n1da1qb1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28660fb94b55fd62a53693597a8da214dd91d47b\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/D1WLINT\">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/D1WLINT</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Next, the crypto market.</p>\n\n<p>Back in 2020/2021, the OCC issued three interpretive letters, which effectively allowed banks to use stablecoins as reserves.  Following these, the entire crypto market saw massive gains, and nearly every stock had a crypto token made after them, which was likely used as a derivative instrument in the crypto market.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tsp902ool1qb1.png?width=723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09b304f0467a099cb681035b9fcbd213c34e910f\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/tsp902ool1qb1.png?width=723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09b304f0467a099cb681035b9fcbd213c34e910f\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This is the best reasoning I can see as to why cryptos saw massive gains in 2020/2021.  I blame the banks.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now for UST.  Back in May 2022, UST lost it&#39;s peg to the dollar, and death spiraled to 0.  For the next chart, I will show Luna, which better shows both the rapid rise of crypto and the collapse of UST.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1rygbo7pg1qb1.png?width=1233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1df6d596b5844a4143ed74fe33aba4ffe9dee37\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/1rygbo7pg1qb1.png?width=1233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1df6d596b5844a4143ed74fe33aba4ffe9dee37\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WRMFNS\">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WRMFNS</a></p>\n\n<p>At the exact same time as the collapse, the money in retail money market funds saw an inversion and has been rapidly rising ever since.  This rise is generally attributed to the Fed rate hikes, but the inversion comes two months after the rate hikes started, and the exact date as the UST collapse.  Weird coincidence...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Finally GME/FTX.</p>\n\n<p>Remember the FTX collapse in early November 2022?  There was a massive blip in the market a couple days before that point (perhaps as a result of FTX, but likely something entirely different)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h41vvdnti1qb1.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1791de6f6102d84beb72e95e32987b1fb4e99e66\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/h41vvdnti1qb1.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1791de6f6102d84beb72e95e32987b1fb4e99e66\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In the above chart, the GME crows noticed that tens of millions of shares magically got returned, shown by ORTEX.  A couple days later, the after hours price of GME went crazy because of &quot;IMX partnership&quot;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q7uuq6blj1qb1.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9de1b7d31c0570dd7fd3acce764a439185c1c29f\">The article has since been deleted by YF so I cannot link</a></p>\n\n<p>On the same day as the returned shares, the ratio of the two classes of Berkshire Hathaway stocks went crazy.  Typically the ratio is pegged to 1500, but I have noticed that the ratio of the two shifts around macroeconomic trends.  This type of volatility between the two is the highest since the 2008 financial crisis.  Something BIG happened on October 27, 2022 that we were not told about (unless FTX is the culprit)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xgsc7uqdi1qb1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f314ed58938f806acb70b143cb0006bf818d4b97\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/xgsc7uqdi1qb1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f314ed58938f806acb70b143cb0006bf818d4b97\"></a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I know this is a bunch of random data that has likely little to do with each other, but I think that a lot of what we see by looking at stocks is the result of something much bigger going on and I wanted to put a couple of these happenings in digits.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/cpGqhAq3y0sd6T6AkrbNBuic0lPPZdJ5SUyrpd4P0Tw.jpg\"/></div>"},

I was recently informed about this sub so I decided to see if anything in the realm of BBBY stood out as odd.  Here is what I found :)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Last night, I looked at the daily trade volume vs. the reported exchange volume for GME.</p>\n\n<p>I did this by using data from chart exchange</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nasdaq-gme/exchange-volume/\">https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nasdaq-gme/exchange-volume/</a></p>\n\n<p>and yahoo finance</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/</a></p>\n\n<p>The equation I used was to sum up all the daily exchange volume and divide by the volume from yahoo finance.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/aphb4qcogqlb1.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcd894f1720557041b4344d08346beeb48b79212\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/aphb4qcogqlb1.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcd894f1720557041b4344d08346beeb48b79212\"></a></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the reported volume is pegged to 100% for the most part.  There are two true outliers.  The first is 4Jan2023 and second is 5Jun2023.  5Jun2023 is the &quot;market 0 volume glitch&quot; day.  Not sure what happened on 4Jan2023 that caused a significant under-reporting.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now tonight I took a look a BBBY, expecting to see much of the same... I was very wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the links for BBBY data</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nasdaq-bbby/exchange-volume/\">https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nasdaq-bbby/exchange-volume/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBYQ/history\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBYQ/history</a></p>\n\n<p>... and here is the same chart</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/201taailhqlb1.png?width=1261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b76e47653f6ba59d0439966ebe5f55d76e4adcf\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/201taailhqlb1.png?width=1261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b76e47653f6ba59d0439966ebe5f55d76e4adcf\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The reported volume is never 100% of the trade volume until 17Mar2023, then it pegged to 100% until it turned into BBBYQ</p>\n\n<p>Here is the news around that day.  Looks like it pegged when BBBY announced reverse split plan.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/svhpykc2iqlb1.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e32411e56e0ed713affacf1b57cf92b1daf2d4b\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/svhpykc2iqlb1.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e32411e56e0ed713affacf1b57cf92b1daf2d4b\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I also looked at trade volume for specific exchanges.  Here&#39;s which ones stood out to me.</p>\n\n<p>NYSE Arca.  This exchange is where a lot of ETFs and options chains trade.  There is a positive correlation to NYSE Arca trade volume against price volatility.  Is it due to options, or ETF creation/redemption mechanics?  Look at the volume on 2Nov2021.  54% of total daily volume was through NYSE Arca!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1emzdzy5jqlb1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91f0c25d47aa1d513b2770d4b03fbe4e22d46f6e\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/1emzdzy5jqlb1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91f0c25d47aa1d513b2770d4b03fbe4e22d46f6e\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Off-exchange.  I know darkpool data is reported so often, but remember how the reported volume snaps to 100% on 17Mar2023?  Well that&#39;s where the off-exchange volume shoots up.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qhwjnjrekqlb1.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a1bb00e92de31e770b24750ca425708c7411f1f\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/qhwjnjrekqlb1.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a1bb00e92de31e770b24750ca425708c7411f1f\"></a></p>\n\n<p>If you look at chart exchange, you will see a weird spike on that date, but there is no jump like my data shows.  The reason for this is that chart exchange forces the total volume to be 100% no matter what.  If there is any discrepancy in the data, it still forces 100%.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i3jgz3pokqlb1.png?width=1510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=866e73ea2f100fb597215e038a84e8b8a74e1965\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/i3jgz3pokqlb1.png?width=1510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=866e73ea2f100fb597215e038a84e8b8a74e1965\"></a></p>\n\n<p>It looks to me like the missing volume was somewhere off exchange and only started getting reported on 17Mar2023.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure if this data is meaningful or important in any way, but I haven&#39;t seen this presented anywhere before so I want to put it out there for analysis if anyone chooses to do so.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Cheers :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Technical ANALysis", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#9e8d49"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/HECVUGjZOS8e1scT-4ImP7acpPba-V5NvYZunvfrfLI.jpg\"/></div>"}]
