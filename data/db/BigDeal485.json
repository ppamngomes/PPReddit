Been seeing posts about how the many of of the large brokerages are not in the best of financial shape in this particular time of the market. I don\u2019t want my brokerage (TD Ameritrade now converting over to Schwab) to sell my shares without my permission, which I have heard is a possibility when the baby moonshots, in order for the brokerage to protect itself. It\u2019s got me thinking perhaps I should DRS some and since I haven\u2019t done it yet I\u2019m considering the timing of when to do it. </p>\n\n<p>Also a chance that I\u2019m completely wrong on getting liquidated without my permission but regardless, still trying to be prepared.  Any wrinkled brains want to chime in and give their thoughts it would be appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>PS - Been watching and listening to the PPshow religiously the last few weeks and can\u2019t get enough.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#94e044"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
