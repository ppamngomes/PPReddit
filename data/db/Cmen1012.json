At first I thought yes the guy is rich but not rich enough to make the Big Bang that we may be looking for. Most of his wealth (2.3+billion) is in stocks, bonds, etc.  However, if you look back to tweets as far back as May 2022, I am intrigued by the the thought of the \u201cPulte Plan\u201d involving some innovation around home building and furnishing (possibly including adding another company under his belt). The Pulte Plan structure was established by his late grandfather who saw Bed Bath and Beyond thrive during an economic recession because it was trusted. It would not be outrageous if the late great William J. Pulte suggested buying such a company if an opportunity presented itself. Pulte was the sole inheritor of his grandpas wealth because he knew that he would carry out the plan that would help people.  It made me wonder how much could he possibly have inherited\u2014 WELL 2 billion is the absolute bottom number.  If you see the link, his late grandfather\u2019s wealth was just this 15 YEARS before he passed away. Pulte can help a lot of people with 2+ billion that he didn\u2019t have prior but I\u2019m guessing this is more around 5-6 billion. Let the crazy Pulte tweets and tinfoil flow.
