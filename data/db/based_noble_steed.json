Pulte came as close as he could to saying RC is involved without legally saying he is. IMO Pulte is trying to support the movement and bring awareness to the stock without &quot;officially&quot; endorsing it. It&#39;s clear that Pulte isn&#39;t allowed to talk in depth about this stock, probably for legal reasons, but he&#39;s leaving as many clues as he can for us to connect the dots. I think Pulte knows this is the play thats going to trigger short covering, and once they start covering we will likely see hedgefunds get liquidated and basket stocks run. Pulte is here for a reason, he knows this stock is the tip of the spear, and the PP show is the tip of dick thats gonna fuck hard!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
