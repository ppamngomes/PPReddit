But I\u2019m have a hard time understanding shorts. Why don\u2019t shorts settle their positions once they are positive? Do the have to keep them for a certain amount of time? I\u2019m just curious as to why they didn\u2019t settle their positions when the stock ran down to 4cents. Is it because their isn\u2019t enough shares in the market to buy? Are they slowly starting to settle out? Also are some hedge funds so brazen they don\u2019t settle out when they are positive because they are stupid or dumb cocks?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
