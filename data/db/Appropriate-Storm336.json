For some reason I heard the words EVERY DETAIL MATTERS, in my head from the GMEDD interview with RC.\nTo all the retail investors who have held the line for months if not more than a year let me reiterate. EVERY DETAIL MATTERS.\nDetails:\nYou can\u2019t get married again unless you get a divorce first. Shares being cancelled is akin to a marriage being annulled. To received new shares, first the old ones need to be extinguished/ cancelled. Only then can you re marry / get new shares of the new entity. \nThe announcement to cancel shares  happened after close. Which means no matter how hard MSM and the shills come roaring out trying to scare retailers, RC has ensured that even if you want to sell, you cannot! He\u2019s taken away the sell button for your own benefit. Every detail matters.<br/>\nExpect shareholders to receive some positive news before market opens Monday. \nEverything that has been done is to protect retail investors. Bread crumbs have been left all over the place. He\u2019s not going to abandon retailers with any careless move just before the finish line. Remember, every detail matters.\nSharing some key snippets from the interview. \nSears: potentially same situation. Shorted to death.<br/>\nTeddy: no comment. Says a lot don\u2019t you think! \nAnother squeeze: hard to predict financial markets. You \u2018never\u2019 know. I bet he does know. And soon you shall too! \nOpportunities: always looking for opportunities. Consumer business is his core competency. Hmm..\nSigning off with, watch the clip again. Will ease a lot of tentative nerves some of you may be feeling by listening to and seeing the hardest working man in corporate America who also happens to have integrity unmatched by anyone in corporate America today! His vision is big. And he knows we are his biggest asset base. You don\u2019t fuck around with that! You capitalise on it which is exactly what\u2019s he\u2019s doing. \nHave a great weekend.\nNFA</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "Speculation/Opinion", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#ffd635"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/Y3Q2MjVzNWxoZnJiMc4oESwqyrmGLsEHWoLFsRXtntkQe9ThX4FVhT6dzBLb.png?width=140&amp;height=77&amp;crop=140:77,smart&amp;format=jpg&amp;v=enabled&amp;lthumb=true&amp;s=a6031b208079c23155cb8ed1312a7fc1fc6882d3\"/></div>"},
