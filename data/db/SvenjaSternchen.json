And suddenly the gates on the roof opened. Helicopters took off from there. In broad daylight, the light show and music started. Ryan Cohen stepped forward, we looked up at him. It was the start of something big and hardly anyone saw it but us. Ryan didn&#39;t seem to care. I knew: To him it&#39;s not about the audience, it&#39;s about the cause.
