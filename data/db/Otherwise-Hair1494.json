This will be completed within this week or next week. The reason why it hasn\u2019t happened yet is because they do what\u2019s called a \u201cPenny For A Lot\u201d process which is done through Apex clearing house and takes a little longer than other brokerages. The rep also stated a placeholder will be added to your account for accounting/booking to know how many shares you had on record. Lastly, I asked if they could provide me with the CUSIP number associated with ticker BBBYQ and she confirmed it\u2019s # 075896100.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
