This is a regulatory requirement and not a decision made by Wealthsimple. You should have received an email about this. If you didn&#39;t, please let us know. </p>\n\n<p>USER: I didn\u2019t receive an email.  </p>\n\n<p>BOT: I apologize for the inconvenience. You should have received an email.

However, the specific details can vary depending on the circumstances. In the case of BBBYQ, the shares were removed due to regulatory requirements when the stock was delisted and moved to the OTC market. </p>\n\n<p>USER: can to explain the regulatory requirements? </p>\n\n<p>BOT: When a stock is delisted and moved to the OTC market, it no longer meets the requirements to be traded on our platform. This is due to settlement or average daily trading volume requirements. We only allow securities to be traded that settle with the Canadian Depository for Securities (CDS). We also impose minimum price and volume constraints for stocks traded on the platform. In most cases, orders can\u2019t be submitted for securities that are delisted or suspended. However, you can sell securities that are no longer supported so long as they have not been delisted and are still being traded. </p>\n\n<p>USER: So what happens if bbbyq emerges from chapter 11 proceedings and there is a share/cash deal presented to shareholders? </p>\n\n<p>BOT: If BBBYQ emerges from Chapter 11 and there&#39;s a share/cash deal for shareholders, it would be considered a corporate action. Our back-office processes all mandatory corporate actions on your shareholdings, so no action is required on your end. However, if it&#39;s a voluntary corporate action, you can choose to opt-in. If you wish to participate, we need to receive instructions 5 business days prior to the deadline. There&#39;s a processing fee of $50 plus tax. Please let us know if you wish to participate in a voluntary corporate action. </p>\n\n<p>USER: what is the voluntary action? </p>\n\n<p>BOT: A voluntary corporate action is an event initiated by the company that affects its shareholders, but participation is not automatic. Shareholders have the option to participate or not. Examples include rights issues, tender offers, and warrant exercises.

When your BBBYQ shares were delisted, they were held with the DTCC. This means the shares are in a sort of &#39;limbo&#39; where they are not in your account but they still belong to you. </p>\n\n<p>USER: Does the dtcc still hold my bbbyq shares? </p>\n\n<p>BOT: Yes, the DTCC would still hold your BBBYQ shares after they were delisted and removed from your Wealthsimple account.
