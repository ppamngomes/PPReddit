And if he would need that, why not get his lawyers to write it? Would retail have to fend for their interests, when NOLs already require us to be kept alive? Worlds best team of lawyers brought us to this point; was it all just for a fancy liquidation, or is there something more going on? If the process needed more transparency, more bids, if RC wanted in, in the prima facile way 1728 suggests, RC already had months to bid on all this shit. Would he really need random investors to get a foot in? </p>\n\n<p>My conclusion: if RC is in, shareholders are in good hands. If RC is not in, yes, then we need to fend for our interests. But if RC is not in, he thought BBBY hopeless, maybe corrupt - if he is not in, or one of his friends, we are likely fucked, regardless of 1728. But did BBBY leadership get Estin, Holly, etc, just to liquidate and fuck us over more expensively? If BBBY wanted to get fucked, why did they fight, nail, tooth and claw, to protecc against smelly Glenn? No, that\u2019s not it. BBBY leaders are not corrupt. Same team that shat on Glenn, want exclusivity and were happy to be granted it by P the G. It comes back to RC. If he\u2019s in, if Carl is in, this has been in the works for long time. Let them continue in silence under exclusivity agreements. If RC not in, then we have put up what we could, but let us then accept our situation. Only scenario where 1728 makes sense, is if RC not in (he wouldn\u2019t need our help putting in random dockets) and we have to fight ourselves. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll take my chances, on RC being in and letting the process be undisturbed. If BBBY lawyers, that fucked Glenn, want exclusivity, give them that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to NOW separate from this team, to ostensibly \u201cfight for RC\u201d by allowing anyone to offer new ch11 plans. Fuck that. Look, at this point you are in one of two camps; team holly, or team not-holly. Who the fuck is in team not-holly? Oh, I know. Glenn and his greasy friends, for sure. I won\u2019t take the risk. </p>\n\n<p>If RC in, we are already in good hands. If RC not in, then he isn\u2019t, for a reason. These were the chances we took when we bought, let\u2019s stick to that. Inventing a new way, \u201cfor RC\u201d - no. My 50c.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
