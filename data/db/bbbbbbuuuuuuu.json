So they were talking about needing the dip financing for payroll, but that was kind of more focused on the store personnel I thought. So are people still working at corporate? Are they leaving in droves? What do they think is happening? I would think MSM would be delighted to report how many loss jobs there are over the company going bankrupt.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
