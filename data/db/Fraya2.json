I was curious to apply these principles to **BBBY** (specialty retail) and here's what I found when learning about hedging:\n\n**BBW**, **BARK**, **JOAN**, and **BBBY** were last seen hanging out together around Aug-Sept 2022. They have since drifted apart. Although, because they are in the same industry AND are affected by similar underlying forces (those that affect specialty retail), we can assume that they will meet up again soon. We're looking at the **1H** Chart here...\n\nIF I wanted to hedge my bet, ideally what I'd do while looking at this specific chart is:\n\n1. short sell the top two, **BBW** & **BARK** \n\n2. buy the bottom two, **JOAN** & **BBBY**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, if I wanted to be long on ANY of these positions, I would want it to be **BBBY**. It is extremely oversold and also far surpasses **BBW** (the purple line) every couple of months; and **BBW**'s share price is currently $22.99. Think about that! \n\nSEE YOU ON THE MOON, HODL, NFA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pbr3606wdoha1.jpg?width=1273&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7c7eed2fa81bfed08e3cbad73d3cd3a870f20e03", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/zyG_AX4jIT4rGWv8h_84SxUFlzHfg6yzW2rsq9Z9c8c.jpg\"/></div>"}]
