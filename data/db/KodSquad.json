If it had been shares, instead it would have allowed litigation to continue. </p>\n\n<p>I think this still may be positive, but much more strongly points to a cash buyout. Or, this precedent may not be the one to get the case dismissed.</p>\n\n<p>From the case cited, within the cited case.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9kou7e0wyazb1.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5072b841bf53cd20152f3d35b835f84812769ccb\"><img style=\"max-width: 100%\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/9kou7e0wyazb1.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5072b841bf53cd20152f3d35b835f84812769ccb\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In this case, cash and stock was received so litigation was allowed to continue. How does that effect RC if hes involved at a higher level, part of a purchase, merger, butterfly - I dont know.</p>\n\n<p>So really I think we find ourselves in the same position we have been, legal precedents to supports multiple potential different outcomes, but something to be taken and added into the collective knowledge we have, maybe it connects a dot for someone else.</p>\n\n<p>I bring this up because I see a troubling trend, in which simply seeing the word &quot;merger&quot; or &quot;acquisition&quot; in a document is enough to generate hype with absolutely no reason.</p>\n\n<p>Take the next step - I am rather smooth brained, but I can use google and CTRL-F, do one further step of research, false hype on every single utterance of a word related to this whole thing doesnt help us in the long run, and I think works to spread misinformation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "flair": {"text": "BIG PP DD", "text_color": "dark", "back_color": "#0dd3bb"}, "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/RBcaD1BNbfdYQzNivzaVsNDoXJe2QkMXCn5t53UvkCQ.jpg\"/></div>"},
