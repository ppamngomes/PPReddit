They are likely under investigation for amount of shares they own.</p>\n\n<p>We also know that NASDAQ has not posted this delisting or announcement publically on their side, likely due to an ongoing investigation.</p>\n\n<p>Today ComputerShare reached out saying it&#39;s an internal problem and not a DDoS attack. AST still remains offline. Once again likely due to an investigation.</p>\n\n<p>What we do know, through the filings of the HBC deal is there was very low Dilution that occured by comparing the shares between the deal and the BK court case.</p>\n\n<p>We also know the S-3 did dilute (3x Free Float?) but the shares were essentially locked the whole time leaving nothing for available shares to be borrowed minus 6.5M of the approx. 300M.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of Dilution with no shares to borrow, short interest increased by 27%. How when they were never available?</p>\n\n<p>What we know is Credit Suisse held onto some rather large bags of shorts against the MEME Stocks and ended up having to go bankrupt due to a run on the banks and UBS took their bags. This is still getting decided in court, but with BBBY approaching delisting I believe there is more fire to close up what they need.</p>\n\n<p>FRC completely went BK after BBBY <em>Voluntarily</em> filed for chapter 11. Coincidence?</p>\n\n<p>BBBY made so many confusing deals with the Dilution and even the bond market that noone can easily figure out what numbers are which, only speculatiins.</p>\n\n<p>BBBY proposed a R/S that many tinfoilers like myself thought would never go through and it didn&#39;t. No major Dilution occured until after the stock suffered from that announcement. </p>\n\n<p>While filing for Chapter 11, this gives the company the option for buy backs in which they COULD have bought back their Dilution at a cheaper price after getting a merchandise funding agreement which left them wiggle room to do so. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, FTDs are normally out first thing in the morning and yet they have not been seen.</p>\n\n<p>I believe naked shorting is under investigation not just with BBBY and because of that I don&#39;t think we are getting delisted.</p>\n\n<p>Have you not noticed we aren&#39;t getting boxed down anymore and exchanges stopped selling the securities?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Although, we have filed chapter 11 about a week ago, CANADA has filed much earlier. </p>\n\n<p>This is a more complex strategy, but quite possible. Due to having the Canadian side under bankruptcy and not Chapter 7, this may give a loophole to allow the company to purchase shares back under this entity, since entering Bankruptcy (not Chapter 7) the ability to repurchase shares back. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s quite odd the next day of raising their $48M the volume doubled. This makes me believe there was a repurchase at this day. They are not technically lying, just delaying the truth. </p>\n\n<p>The reason for the need of funds was for product, but at the same time they were offered somewhere around $50M product funding deal. Which eliminates the need for the $48M raised and can be used to repurchase the shares back. </p>\n\n<p>If that&#39;s the case the float can be back to 116M or lower. </p>\n\n<p>Even if Canada BK isn&#39;t an allowable reason to buy back, after BBBY officially announced the Chapter 11, they are legally allowed to buy back shares, in which it could even be really lower as the price declined since.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, they turtlenecked...

It&#39;s currently at 1.2B and kepts growing all week! If Sue has anything good, that&#39;s the date she&#39;s going to use. Plus there is two other close gamma ramps listed.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, we have no idea when earnings will be released or if they will even give us a heads up. To my knowledge, BBBY does not need to release the date, but we know it&#39;s coming. </p>\n\n<p>Typically when we have poor results in the past the company would tell us in advanced so that the stock price doesn&#39;t tank at earnings. We have not seen this yet, they did hint some struggle points, but pretty vague if anything.</p>\n\n<p>Sue has been over confident this past week and we have been seeing some strange behaviour with how they have been wording things that seem very skeptical. She also is pushing the women are equal movement which they used a lady From eToro to give it. I think it was quite the setup going into this week. Plus the lady says discuss rumors around bankruptcy in her introduction. </p>\n\n<p>We have seen some dilution from the company to get more equity to starve off bankruptcy. To me and the way they have the S-1 layed out, just screams it&#39;s a bear trap because they couldve written it in a way that they wouldn&#39;t dilute to pennies. They just got a a partner to put up a lot of money in keeping the stores stocked up. Sue also thanked all the people who are helping meaning there are lots trying to make BBBY succeed. Sue also used the words maintain and grow, nothing negative.</p>\n\n<p>Earnings in my opinion are going to be far better than expected. We had store closeouts which cuts expenses and provided more liquid cash. We were introduced to the rewards+ program that&#39;s generating a lot of revenue. Earnings will likely provide DRS numbers and maybe explain why there is only 3.5M available shares to borrow. </p>\n\n<p>FTD numbers get announced, so we will see the fuckery in that and how we never ran higher than 3.5M borrowed shares. </p>\n\n<p>Banks are reporting this week, I can&#39;t see see them being too great. This could wipe out a lot of collateral for hedge funds.</p>\n\n<p>We have failed the GAMMA ramps in the past, but if a catalyst comes this week it&#39;ll be a huge bull run. I&#39;m confident if we get to $0.50 it will run to the $40 mark which sounds insane.</p>\n\n<p>I think we have a good chance this week, so get your tits Jacked we are going long!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},
