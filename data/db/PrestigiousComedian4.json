I also received help from GPT in creating this.  I don&#39;t cook the books like fucking shorts do.  Hope you all enjoy it and that it&#39;s not a FTD. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 1: Skeptical Investments and Hidden Agendas</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Shill</strong>: Trust me, investing in BBBYQ was like throwing your money into a black hole.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PP</strong>: Oh please, you just don\u2019t want the stock to make a come-back because you&#39;ve got your own dirty little game going. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Shill</strong>: You think you know everything, don&#39;t you?  That stock is dead in the water. I&#39;ve done my research.  It\u2019s worthless!! It went to 0. Let me repeat myself.  IT\u2019S WORTHLESS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 2: The Accusations and the Comeback</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>PP</strong>: (smirks) Aren\u2019t you the one with the \u201cbig naked secret\u201d?  Betting against a comeback is a rookie&#39;s move.  You sure you got this all figured out?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shill</strong>: Keep smirking. Only a fool would hold onto hope for that train wreck of a company. I bet you people believe the world is flat too!</p>\n\n<p><strong>PP</strong>: How many times have we talked about this already!!  Let me be clear with you. It\u2019s only Daniel who thinks that around here. NO ONE ELSE.   <em>Thank youuuuu.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>PP</strong> (after catching his breath): Let&#39;s get back on topic now.  Perhaps, just, just maybe\u2026I figured something out. Or maybe everyone knows something about you.  Do you remember the exceedingly high volume of shares traded before the shares were \u201crecalled\u201d. Where did they all come from? Not naked shorting, riiiiight?! (winks) </p>\n\n<p><strong>Shill</strong>: (dismissively) I have nothing to hide!  You just threw good money after bad.  It&#39;s sad, really.  Your shares are worthless!! THE SHARES ARE WORTH NADA, NOTHING!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 3: Market Shock and Schadenfreude</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>(Suddenly, the news anchor on TV announces that the stock is back on the NYSE and has begun to squeeze.)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>TV Anchor</strong>: Breaking news!  There&#39;s an unexpected twist in the stock market as BBBYQ makes a comeback by relaunching its shares under the new ticker symbol BUTTFQ on the NYSE, and the stock price is soaring!</p>\n\n<p><strong>PP</strong>: (pointing at the screen, grinning) Look at that!  What was that you were saying about dead in the water earlier?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shill</strong>: (face paler than mayo, fuming) This can&#39;t be happening.  There must be some mistake - some temporary glitch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PP</strong>: (mockingly) Aww, look at you. Do you need a tissue? I promise it\u2019s not <em>synthetic</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shill</strong>: This isn&#39;t over and I don\u2019t need your fucking tissue! There&#39;s no way they can pull off a recovery like this!</p>\n\n<p>PP: (shaking his head, chuckling) For someone so confident, you sure didn&#39;t see this coming, did you?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 4: The Twist of Fate</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>(At that moment, the FBI bursts into the bar.</strong>  <strong>The shill staring in disbelief, the agent approaching)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>FBI Agent:</strong> Are you uhh, the Shill in Shambles?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shill</strong>: (stammering, completely caught off guard) What, what\u2019s this about? </p>\n\n<p><strong>FBI Agent</strong>: (Flashing badge) You&#39;re under arrest. Allegations of domestic assault with a... bedpost, was it? Your wife&#39;s boyfriend gave us quite the statement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PP</strong>: (laughing) Well, isn\u2019t this a plot twist?  I didn\u2019t know this was a part of your \u201chands on\u201d asset management strategy.  I thought they\u2019d get you for all of your alleged naked shorting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SHILL</strong>: (Stands up in disbelief, his distress replaced by fear)* No, no, no!  You\u2019ve got it all wrong!  This is a setup!  I\u2019m going to call the SEC right now!!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>FBI AGENT</strong>: They\u2019re uh a little busy right now at the computer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PP</strong>: Well there you have it! Fuck around and find out!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"},

Bidding order states if no successful bids then it goes to auction. They could ONLY have cancelled the auction if there was a successful bid.
