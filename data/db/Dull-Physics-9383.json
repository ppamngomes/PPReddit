I'm gonna see if I can get a transfer to a brokerage that does OTC regardless but fuck this is what we have been waiting for no? A conclusion to this madness, hopefully that's coming soon. \n\nMay 3rd, that's one fucking week holy shit I've held for a long ass time I can at least hold another week. \n\nMaybe I've drank the last drop of Kool Aid but I'm just not fucking buying the narrative the media and the stock price is trying to portray to us. The shorts should have complete control of the price, the company is going bk, we're getting delisted, they've won. Why aren't they just shorting it into fucking oblivion sent it to damn .00000001. Why is the price even going up at all? And before you say \"oh retails buying the dip\" It's fucking After Hours where retail already doesn't trade ANDD is getting buy buttons removed. Why did it all get sent to the fucking Arca too? It doesn't fucking add up. I think we're going to continue to see price action and it's gonna fucking squeeze because of one reason. Greed... These fuckers are the greediest sacks of literal dogshit. With how long BBBY has dragged things on they're gonna want a piece of shit gigantic bag they've been salivating over. The off exchange dropped to like 64%+8 cboe if it goes back up I think they're bullshitting us. They are gonna do all the work and eat each other limb by limb we just have to sit back and watch.", "preview": "<div class=\"img_container\"><img class=\"card-image\" src=\"self\"/></div>"}]
